This font  comes unlicensed. However on the Typophile forum where the font was originally launched, the question was asked:  "Hi, Beautiful font. Iâ€™d like to use it for a commercial project. I tried to find its license and on FontSquirrel it says it has none. Usually the fonts there are for commercial use. So, could I use it? If yes, thank you, if no, how/where can I buy it? :)"

Andrew's response: "Hi Kenny, Feel free to use it commercially as it is license free. Cheers!"
