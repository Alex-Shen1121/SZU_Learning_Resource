63
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,510
Next when you are given
您将得到下一个

64
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,170
a new example X. So
一个新的样本X，所以

65
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,430
if you are given a test example,
如果给你一个测试的样本，

66
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,240
lets take an earlier example to have a new example out here.
让作为一个早期的样本有一个新的样本在这里。

67
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,790
And that is my test example.
那是我的测试样本。

68
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,670
Given the new example X, what
鉴于新的样本X，

69
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,220
we are going to do is compute

70
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,420
P of X, using this

71
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,250
formula for the multivariate Gaussian distribution.
式为多元高斯分布。

72
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,220
And then, if P of
然后，如果p(x)

73
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,840
X is very small, then we
是非常小的，那么我们

74
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,800
flagged it as an anomaly,
把它当作一个异常，

75
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,570
whereas, if P of X is greater

76
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,520
than that parameter epsilon, then

77
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,190
we don't flag it as an anomaly.
我们不会将其标记为异常。

78
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,240
So it turns out, if we were to fit a multivariate Gaussian distribution to this data set,
所以，事实证明，如果我们要拟合多元高斯分布到这组数据，

79
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,220
so just the red crosses, not the green example,

80
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,100
you end up with a Gaussian

87
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,350
And so, if you apply

Let's say, with non-0 elements on the

147
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:11,970
So, it turns out that

148
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,980
it's possible to show mathematically that

all of those are going to be zero.

164
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,380
And in fact if you take

165
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,980

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,130
two models are actually identical.
两个模型实际上是相同的。

172
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,560
That is, this new model,

182
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,500

所以你不允许模型的不同特征之间的相关性。

183
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,520
So in that sense the original model

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,840
is actually a special case of this multivariate Gaussian model.
其实这个多元高斯模型的一个特例。

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,370
So when would you use each of these two models?

186
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,750
So when would you the original

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,670
The original model is probably

190
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,840
used somewhat more often,

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,160

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,470
distribution is used somewhat
分布用的有点

193
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,670
less but it has the advantage of being

194
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,290
able to capture correlations between features. So

195
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,600
suppose you want to

196
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,100
capture anomalies where you

on unusual combinations of values
不同的值的组合。

200
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,320
so in the earlier
因此，在早期的

201
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:27,320
example, we had that example where the anomaly was with the CPU load and the memory use taking on unusual combinations of values, if
例如，我们有这样的样本，其中的异常是与CPU的负载，并采取对价值观的不同寻常的组合，内存使用，如果

202
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,220
you want to use the original
要使用原始

203
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,500
model to capture that, then what you

204
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,650
need to do is create an
需要做的是创建一个

205
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,780
extra feature, such as X3

equals X1/X2, you know

207
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,480
equals maybe the CPU load divided by the memory used, or something, and you

208
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,030
need to create extra features

itself and X2 by itself
本身和X2本身

214
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,530
looks like it's taking a perfectly normal value. But if you're willing to spend the time to manually
看起来像它采取了完全正常的值。但是，如果你愿意花时间去手动

215
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,240
create an extra feature like this,
创建这样一个额外的特征，

216
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,670
then the original model will work
那么原始模型将工作

217
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:14,170
fine.  Whereas in contrast, the multivariate Gaussian model can automatically capture

218
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:23,360
correlations between different features. But the original model has some other more significant advantages, too, and one huge

219
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,990
advantage of the original model
利用原始模型

220
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,400
is that it is computationally cheaper, and another view on this

221
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,170
is that is scales better to

224
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,260
features, and so even

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,090
if n were ten thousand,
如果n分别为10000，

226
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,350
or even if n were equal

227
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,600
to a hundred thousand, the original

228
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,120
model will usually work just fine.
原始模型通常会工作得很好。

229
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,930
Whereas in contrast for the multivariate Gaussian model notice here, for
而与此相反，多元高斯模型在这里，

230
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,940
example, that we need to
例如，我们需要

231
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,730
compute the inverse of the matrix

232
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,760
sigma where sigma is

233
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,230
an n by n matrix
一个n×n矩阵

234
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,830
and so computing sigma if

235
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,950
sigma is a hundred thousand by a

236
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,910

237
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,650
And so the multivariate Gaussian model
这样一来，多元高斯模型

238
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,900
scales less well to large

you have a relatively small training

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,600
of course, and this works fine, even if

M is, you

know, maybe 50, 100, works fine.
知道，也许50，100，工作得很好。

249
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,740
Whereas for the multivariate Gaussian, it
而对于多变量高斯分布，它

250
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,340
is sort of a mathematical property
是一种数学性质

251
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,230
of the algorithm that you must have m
你必须有m

252
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:38,810
greater than n, so that the number of examples is greater than the number of features you have. And there's a mathematical property of the way we estimate the parameters
大于n，因此，样本的数目是大于的特征数的。还有的，我们估计参数的方法的数学属性

253
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,850
that if this is not true, so if m is less than or equal to n,
如果这是不正确的，因此，如果m小于或等于n，

254
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:51,610
then this matrix isn't even invertible, that is this matrix is singular, and so you can't even use the
那么这个矩阵甚至不是可逆的，即该矩阵是奇异的，所以你甚至不能使用

255
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,230
multivariate Gaussian model unless you make some changes to it. But a
多元高斯模型，除非你做一些修改。但

256
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,820
typical rule of thumb
这个典型的规则

257
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,760
that I use is, I will use the
我用的就是，我将使用

258
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,500
multivariate Gaussian model only if m is much greater than n, so this is sort of the
多元高斯模型仅当m是大于n大得多，所以这是一种

259
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,750
narrow mathematical requirement, but
狭隘的数学要求，但

260
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,300
in practice, I would use

261
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,910
the multivariate Gaussian model, only
多变量高斯模型，只

262
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,420
if m were quite a bit
如果m是有点点

263
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,870
bigger than n.  So if
大于n大。所以，如果

264
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,320
m were greater than or
m大于或

265
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,780
equal to 10 times n, let's
等于10 n次，让我们

266
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,460
say, might be a reasonable rule of thumb, and if
比方说，可能还是一个合理的经验法则，如果

267
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,890
it doesn't satisfy this, then the multivariate Gaussian model
它不满足这一点，那么多元高斯模型

268
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,320
has a lot
有很多

269
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,850
of parameters, right, so this covariance matrix sigma is an n by n matrix,
的参数，所以这个协方差矩阵sigma是一个n×n矩阵，

270
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,590
so it has, you know, roughly
所以，你知道的，大概

271
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,230
n squared parameters, because it's a symmetric matrix,
n平方的参数，因为它是一个对称矩阵，

272
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,040
it's actually closer to n squared
它实际上更接近到n的平方

273
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,230
over 2 parameters, but this is a
以上2个参数，但是这是一个

274
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,220
lot of parameters, so you need
很多的参数，所以你需要

275
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,720
make sure you have a fairly
确保你有一个相当

276
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:48,350
large value for m, make sure you have enough data to fit all these parameters. And m greater than
大的值给m，请确保您有足够的数据，以适应所有这些参数。m大于

277
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,220
or equal to 10 n would be a reasonable rule of thumb to make sure that you can estimate this covariance matrix sigma reasonably well.
或等于10 N将是一个经验合理的规则，以确保您能够估计这个协方差矩阵sigma还算不错。

278
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,240
So in practice the original
因此在实践中，原始模型

279
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,940
model shown on the left that is used more often.

need to capture correlations between features

if you have 2 features that are the same.

318
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,000
And so there's a debugging set--

319
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,270
this should very rarely happen,

320
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,190
so you probably won't run into this,

321
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,780
it is very unlikely that you have to worry about this--

322
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,480
but in case you implement a

make sure that M is quite

do, is just check for redundant features.
这样做，只是检查多余特征。

329
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,070
And so if there are 2 features

330
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,360
that are equal, just get rid

331
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,590
of one of them, or if

336
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,610
As an aside for those of you
