38
00:01:08,523 --> 00:01:10,947
(so the origin and destination) and
也就是出发地与目的地

39
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:12,748
your website offers to ship the package
然后你的网站开出运输包裹的

40
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:14,515
for some asking price,
的服务价格

41
00:01:14,515 --> 00:01:16,092
so I'll ship your package for $50,

42
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:17,926
I'll ship it for $20.
我会收取$20之类的

43
00:01:17,926 --> 00:01:19,343

00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:20,922
that you offer to the users,
你开给用户的这个价格

45
00:01:20,922 --> 00:01:23,522
the users sometimes chose to use a shipping service;

46
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:25,891
that's a positive example and

50
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:34,552
So let's say that we want
所以 让我们假定我们想要一个

51
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,386
a learning algorithm to help us

they capture, you know, the origin and
它们会获取 比如 包裹的起始地

59
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,405
destination of the package, where they want to ship the package.
以及目的地 他们想把包裹运到哪里去

60
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,635
And what is the price

61
00:01:55,635 --> 00:01:57,911
that we offer to them for shipping the package.

66
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:05,457
package, using our
运输包裹的几率

67
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:07,315
shipping service given these features, and
在已知用户特点的前提下 并且

68
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:10,197
again just as a reminder these
我要再次指出

69
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:14,121
features X also captures the price that we're asking for.
他们也同时获取了我们开出的价格

70
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:15,790
And so if we could

71
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,486
estimate the chance that they'll
估计出用户选择

72
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:19,629
agree to use our service

73
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:20,962
for any given price, then we

74
00:02:20,962 --> 00:02:21,967
can try to pick

75
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:23,183
a price so that they

76
00:02:23,183 --> 00:02:25,125
have a pretty high probability of

77
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,841
choosing our website while simultaneously
选择我们的网站

78
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:29,188
hopefully offering us a
而且同时很有可能会提供给我们

79
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:31,371
fair return, offering us
一个合适的回报 让我们

80
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:34,293
a fair profit for shipping their package.
在提供运输服务时也能获得合适的利润

81
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:36,489
So if we can learn this property
所以如果我们可以学习

82
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,733
of y equals 1 given
y 等于 1 时的条件

83
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:38,632
any price and given the other
在任何给定价格以及其他给定的

84
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:39,660
features we could really
条件下y等于1的特征

85
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,657
use this to choose appropriate
我们就真的可以利用这一些信息

86
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:44,072
prices as new users come to us.
在新用户来的时候选择合适的价格

87
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:45,907
So in order to model
所以为了

88
00:02:45,907 --> 00:02:47,277
the probability of y equals 1,
获得 y 等于 1 的概率的模型

89
00:02:47,277 --> 00:02:48,972
what we can do is use
我们能做的就是

90
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:51,781
logistic regression or neural
用逻辑回归或者神经网络

91
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:53,756
network or some other algorithm like that.
或者其他一些类似的算法

92
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,889
But let's start with logistic regression.
但现在我们先来考虑逻辑回归

93
00:02:57,658 --> 00:02:59,583
Now if you have a
现在假定你有一个

94
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,835
website that just runs continuously,
连续运行的网站

95
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:05,342
here's what an online learning algorithm would do.
以下就是在线学习算法要做的

96
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:07,478
I'm gonna write repeat forever.
我要写下"一直重复"

97
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,730
This just means that our website
这只是代表着我们的网站

98
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,170
is going to, you know, keep on
将会一直继续

99
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,911
staying up.
保持在线学习

100
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:14,351
What happens on the website is
这个网站将要发生的是

101
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:16,465
occasionally a user
一个用户

102
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:17,950
will come and for
偶然访问

103
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,576
the user that comes we'll get
然后我们将会得到

104
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:25,380
some x,y pair corresponding to
与其对应的一些(x,y)对

105
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,096
a customer or to a user on the website.
这些(x,y)对是相对应于一个特定的客户或用户的

106
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:30,884
So the features x are, you
所以特征 x 是指

107
00:03:30,884 --> 00:03:32,811
know, the origin and destination specified
客户所指定的起始地与目的地

108
00:03:32,811 --> 00:03:34,111
by this user and the price
以及

109
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:35,358
that we happened to offer to
我们这一次提供

110
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:37,292
them this time around, and
给客户的价格

111
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:38,430
y is either one or
而y则取1或0

112
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,148
zero depending one whether or
y值取决于

113
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:41,518
not they chose to
客户是否选择了

114
00:03:41,518 --> 00:03:43,980
use our shipping service.
使用我们的运输服务

115
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,419
Now once we get this {x,y}
现在我们一旦获得了这个{x,y}数据对

116
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:46,813
pair, what an online
在线学习算法

117
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:48,391
learning algorithm does is then
要做的就是

118
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:50,690
update the parameters theta
更新参数θ

119
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,011
using just this example
利用刚得到的(x,y)数据对来更新θ

120
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:57,726
x,y, and in particular
具体来说

121
00:03:57,726 --> 00:03:59,839
we would update my parameters theta
我们将这样更新我们的参数θ

122
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,842
as Theta j get updated as Theta j
θj 将会被更新为

123
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:06,619
minus the learning rate alpha times
θj 减去学习率 α 乘以

124
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:11,356
my usual gradient descent
梯度下降

125
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:13,399
rule for logistic regression.
来做逻辑回归

126
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,491
So we do this for j
然后我们对j等于0到n

127
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:15,652
equals zero up to n,
重复这个步骤

128
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:19,088
and that's my close curly brace.
这是我的另一边花括号

129
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:21,218
So, for other learning algorithms
所以对于其他的学习算法

130
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:22,873
instead of writing X-Y, right, I
不是写(x,y)对 对吧

131
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:24,011
was writing things like Xi,
我之前写的是

132
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:26,495
Yi but
(x(i),y(i)) 一样的数据对

133
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,842
in this online learning setting
但在这个在线学习机制中

134
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:29,723
where actually discarding the notion
我们实际上丢弃了

135
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:31,464
of there being a fixed training
获取一个固定的数据集这样的概念

136
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:32,904
set instead we have an algorithm.
取而代之的是 我们拥有一个算法

137
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:34,924
Now what happens as we get
现在 当我们

138
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:37,014
an example and then we
获取一个样本 然后我们

139
00:04:37,014 --> 00:04:38,825
learn using that example like
利用那个样本获取信息学习

140
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:41,031
so and then we throw that example away.
然后我们丢弃这个样本

141
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,098
We discard that example and we
我们丢弃那个样本 而且我们

142
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:45,141
never use it again and
永远不会再使用它

143
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:47,161
so that's why we just look at one example at a time.
这就是为什么我们在一个时间点只会处理一个样本的原因

144
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,879
We learn from that example.
我们从样本中学习

145
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,412
We discard it.
我们再丢弃它

146
