algorithm that was originally motivated
它最初产生的目的是

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,330
by the goal of having machines that can mimic the brain.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,330
Now in this class, of course
在这门课中

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm teaching Neural Networks to you
我将向你们介绍神经网络

6
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,170
because they work really well

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,070
for different machine learning problems and
不同的机器学习问题

8
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,910
not, certainly not because they're logically motivated.
而不只因为它们在逻辑上行得通

9
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,260
In this video, I'd like
在这段视频中 我想

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,640
to give you some of the background on Neural Networks.
告诉你们一些神经网络的背景知识

11
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,430
So that we can get a sense of what we can expect them to do.
由此我们能知道可以用它们来做什么

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,170
Both in the sense of
不管是将其应用到

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,320
applying them to modern day
现代的机器学习问题上

14
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,470
machinery problems, as well as for

15
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,000
those of you that might
那些你可能会

16
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,870
be interested in maybe the

building truly intelligent machines.
能制造出真正的智能机器

19
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,650
Also, how Neural Networks might pertain to that.
另外 我们还将讲解神经网络是怎么涉及这些问题的

20
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,260
The origins of Neural Networks was
神经网络产生的原因

21
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,320
as algorithms that try
是人们想尝试设计出

22
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,880
to mimic the brain and
模仿大脑的算法

23
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,020
those a sense that if we
从某种意义上说如果我们

24
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,750
want to build learning systems
想要建立学习系统

25
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,110
while why not mimic perhaps the
那为什么不去模仿

26
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,960
most amazing learning machine we
我们所认识的 最神奇的学习机器——

27
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,070
know about, which is perhaps the
人类的大脑呢

28
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,710
brain. Neural Networks came to
神经网络逐渐兴起于

29
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,720
be very widely used throughout the
二十世纪八九十年代

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,260
1980's and 1990's and
应用得非常广泛

31
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,840
for various reasons as popularity
但由于各种原因

32
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,680
diminished in the late
在90年代的后期应用减少了

33
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,410
90's. But more recently,
但是最近

34
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,520
Neural Networks  have had a
神经网络

35
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,060
major recent resurgence.
又东山再起了

36
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,530
One of the reasons for this
其中一个原因是

37
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,640
resurgence is that Neural Networks
神经网络

38
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,010
are computationally some what
是计算量有些

39
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,590
more expensive algorithm and
偏大的算法

40
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,110
so, it was only, you know,
然而

41
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,830
maybe somewhat more recently that
大概由于近些年

42
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,190
computers became fast enough
计算机的运行速度变快

43
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,540
to really run large scale
才足以真正运行起大规模的

44
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,610
Neural Networks and because of
神经网络

45
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,950
that as well as a
正是由于这个原因

46
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,940
few other technical reasons which we'll
和其他一些我们后面会讨论到的

47
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,840
talk about later, modern Neural
技术因素

48
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,390
Networks today are the state
如今的神经网络

49
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,620
of the art technique for many applications.
对于许多应用来说是最先进的技术

50
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,000
So, when you think about mimicking
当你想模拟大脑时

51
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,600
the brain while one of
是指想制造出与人类大脑

52
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,860
the human brain does tell me same things, right?
作用效果相同的机器 对吧？

53
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,660
The brain can learn to
大脑可以学会去

54
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,170
see process images than to
以看而不是听的方式处理图像

55
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,330
hear, learn to process our sense of touch.
学会处理我们的触觉

56
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,360
We can, you know, learn to

57
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,380
do math, learn to do

58
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,970
calculus, and the brain

59
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,560
does so many different and amazing things.
各种不同的令人惊奇的事情

60
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,730
It seems like if you want
似乎如果你想要

61
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,280
to mimic the brain it seems
模仿它

62
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,630
like you have to write lots of different
你得写很多不同的

63
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,350
pieces of software to mimic all

64
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,540
of these different fascinating, amazing things
大脑告诉我们的这些

65
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,580
that the brain tell us, but does
五花八门的奇妙的事情

66
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,780
is this fascinating hypothesis that the
不过能不能假设

67
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,100
way the brain does all of
大脑做所有这些

68
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,410
these different things is not
不同事情的方法

69
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,080
worth like a thousand different programs,
不需要用上千个不同的程序去实现

70
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,810
but instead, the way the
相反的 大脑处理的方法

71
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,020
brain does it is worth
只需要

72
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,890
just a single learning algorithm.
一个单一的学习算法就可以了？

73
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,840
This is just a hypothesis but
尽管这只是一个假设

74
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,240
let me share with you
不过让我和你分享

75
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,440
some of the evidence for this.
一些这方面的证据

76
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,840
This part of the brain, that little
大脑的这一部分

77
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,270
red part of the brain, is
这一小片红色区域

78
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,150
your auditory cortex and
是你的听觉皮层

79
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,620
the way you're understanding my voice
你现在正在理解我的话

80
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,340
now is your ear is
这靠的是耳朵

81
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,940
taking the sound signal and routing
耳朵接收到声音信号

82
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,940
the sound signal to your auditory
并把声音信号传递给你的

83
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,180
cortex and that's what's
听觉皮层 正因如此

84
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,100
allowing you to understand my words.
你才能明白我的话

85
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,590
Neuroscientists have done the
神经系统科学家做了

86
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,560
following fascinating experiments where
下面这个有趣的实验

87
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,300
you cut the wire from
把耳朵到

88
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,440
the ears to the auditory
听觉皮层的神经切断

89
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,100
cortex and you re-wire,
在这种情况下

90
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,010
in this case an animal's brain, so
将其重新接到一个动物的大脑上

91
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,310
that the signal from the eyes
这样从眼睛到

92
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,890
to the optic nerve eventually gets routed to the auditory cortex.
视神经的信号最终将传到听觉皮层

93
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,140
If you do this it turns out,
如果这样做了 那么结果表明

94
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,620
the auditory cortex will learn
听觉皮层将会

95
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,400
to see.
学会“看”

96
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,000
And this is in every single sense
这里“看”代表了

97
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,270
of the word see as we know it.
我们所知道的每层含义

98
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,470
So, if you do this to the animals,
所以 如果你对动物这样做

99
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,790
the animals can perform visual discrimination
那么动物就可以完成视觉辨别任务

100
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,260
task and as they can
它们可以

101
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,570
look at images and make appropriate
看图像 并根据图像

102
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,190
decisions based on the
做出适当的决定

103
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,460
images and they're doing
它们正是通过

104
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,300
it with that piece of brain tissue.
脑组织中的这个部分完成的

105
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,150
Here's another example.
下面再举另一个例子

106
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,430
That red piece of brain tissue is your somatosensory cortex.
这块红色的脑组织是你的躯体感觉皮层

107
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,680
That's how you process your sense of touch.
这是你用来处理触觉的

108
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,020
If you do a similar re-wiring process
如果你做一个和刚才类似的重接实验

109
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,740
then the somatosensory cortex will learn to see.
那么躯体感觉皮层也能学会”看“

110
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,710
Because of this and other
这个实验和其它一些

111
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,670
similar experiments, these are
类似的实验

112
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,200
called neuro-rewiring experiments.
被称为神经重接实验

113
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,550
There's this sense that if
从这个意义上说 如果

114
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,670
the same piece of physical
人体有同一块

115
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,020
brain tissue can process sight
脑组织可以处理光、

116
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,970
or sound or touch then

117
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,480
maybe there is one learning
那么也许存在一种学习算法

118
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,870
algorithm that can process
可以同时处理

119
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,520
sight or sound or touch.
视觉、听觉和触觉

120
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,660
And instead of needing to
而不是需要

121
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,530
implement a thousand different programs
运行上千个不同的程序

122
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,520
or a thousand different algorithms to

123
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,430
do, you know, the thousand wonderful things
大脑所完成的

124
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,510
that the brain does, maybe what
成千上万的美好事情

125
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,980
we need to do is figure out
也许我们需要做的就是找出

126
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,900
some approximation or to whatever

127
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,220
the brain's learning algorithm is and
实际的大脑学习算法

128
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,470
implement that and that the

131
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,180
To a surprisingly large extent,
在很大的程度上

132
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,730
it seems as if we can
可以猜想如果我们

133
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,440
plug in almost any sensor
把几乎任何一种传感器

134

135
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,030
the brain and so, within the
几乎任何一个部位的话

136
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,990
reason, the brain will learn to deal with it.

149
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,630
and you then run a wire
你连一根线

150
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,710
to an array of electrodes
到舌头上安装的

151
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,540
that you place on your tongue
电极阵列上

152
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,370
so that each pixel gets mapped

154
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,300
tongue where maybe a
某个位置上

155
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,850
high voltage corresponds to a
