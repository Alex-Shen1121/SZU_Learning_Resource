00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,162
在这段视频中 我想很快地介绍一下这门课程
(字幕整理：中国海洋大学 黄海广,haiguang2000@qq.com )

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,162
In this video, I want to just quickly step you
through the logistics of how to work on

3
00:00:04,162 --> 00:00:09,387
做作业的流程 以及如何使用作业提交系统

4
00:00:04,162 --> 00:00:09,387
homeworks in this class and how to use the
submission system which will let you verify

5
00:00:09,387 --> 00:00:15,619
这个提交系统可以即时检验你的机器学习程序答案是否正确

6
00:00:09,387 --> 00:00:15,619
right away that you got the right answer for
your machine learning program exercise.

7
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:19,354
这是我的 Octave 编程窗口 让我们先进入到我的桌面

8
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:19,354
Here's my Octave window and
let's first go to my desktop.

9
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:25,374
我在我的桌面上保存了我的第一个练习和一些文件

10
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:25,374
I saved the files for my first exercise,
some of the files on my desktop:

11
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:27,994
在 'ml-class-ex1' 目录中

12
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:27,994
in this directory, 'ml-class-ex1'.

13
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:32,921
我们提供了大量的文件 其中有一些需要由你自己来编辑

14
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:32,921
And we provide a number files
and ask you to edit some of them.

15
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:40,701
因此第一个文件应该符合编程练习中 pdf 文件的要求

16
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:40,701
So the first file should meet the details in
the pdf file for this programming exercise.

17
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:45,352
其中一个我们要求你编写的文件是 warmUpExercise.m 这个文件

18
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:45,352
But one of the files we ask you to edit is
this file called warmUpExercise.m, where the

19
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:49,890
这个文件只是为了确保你熟悉提交系统

20
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:49,890
exercise is really just to make sure that
you're familiar with the submission system.

21
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,795
所有你需要做的就是提交一个5×5的矩阵

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,795
And all you need to do is
return the 5x5 identity matrix.

23
00:00:53,795 --> 00:01:00,301
因此这个练习的答案 我给你们写过 就是 A = eye(5)

24
00:00:53,795 --> 00:01:00,301
So the solution to this exercise I just
showed you is to write A = eye(5).

25
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:05,766
这将修改该函数以产生5×5的单位矩阵

26
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:05,766
So that modifies this function to
generate the 5x5 identity matrix.

27
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:11,149
现在warmUpExercise() 这个方程就实现了返回5x5的单位矩阵

28
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:11,149
And this function warmUpExercise()
now returns the 5x5 identity matrix.

29
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:13,727
将它保存一下

30
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:13,727
And I'm just going to save it.

31
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:17,465
所以我已经完成了作业的第一部分 现在回到我的 Octave 窗口

32
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:17,465
So I've done the first part of this homework.
Going back to my Octave window,

33
00:01:17,465 --> 00:01:27,185
现在来到我的目录 C:\Users\ang\Desktop\ml-class-ex1

34
00:01:17,465 --> 00:01:27,185
let's now go to my directory,
'C:\Users\ang\Desktop\ml-class-ex1'.

35
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:33,347
如果我想确保我已经实现了程序 像这样输入'warmUpExercise()'

36
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:33,347
And if I want to make sure that I've implemented
this, type 'warmUpExercise()' like so.

37
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:39,671
好了它返回了我们用刚才写的代码创建的一个5x5的单位矩阵

38
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:39,671
And yup, it returns the 5x5 identity matrix
that we just wrote the code to create.

39
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:43,870
我现在可以按如下步骤提交代码 我要在这里目录下键入 submit()

40
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:43,870
And I can now submit the code as follows.
I'm going to type 'submit()' in this

41
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:49,300
我要提交第一部分 所以我选择输入'1'

42
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:49,300
directory and I'm ready to submit part 1
so I'm going to enter choice '1'.

43
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,387
这时它问我我的电子邮件地址 我们打开课程网站

44
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,387
So it asks me for my email address.
I'm going go to the course website.

45
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:59,682
这是一个内部测试网站 所以你的版本可能看起来有点不同

46
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:59,682
This is an internal testing site, so your version
of the website may look a little bit different.

47
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:07,934
这是我的电子邮件地址 和我的提交密码 我需要在这里输入

48
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:07,934
But that's my email address and this is my submission
password, and I'm just going to type them in here.

49
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:19,205
所以我的邮箱是 ang@cs.stanford.edu 我的提交密码就是 9yC75USsGf

50
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:19,205
So I have ang@cs.stanford.edu and
my submission password is 9yC75USsGf.

51
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:23,849
按下回车键 它连接到服务器 并将其提交

52
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:23,849
I'm going to hit enter; it connects to the server
and submits it, and right away

53
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:28,567
然后它就会立刻告诉你 恭喜您 已成功完成作业1第1部分

54
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:28,567
it tells you "Congratulations! You have
successfully completed Homework 1 Part 1".

55
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:33,160
这就确认了你已经做对了第一部分练习

56
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:33,160
And this gives you a verification
that you got this part right.

57
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,795
如果你提交的答案不正确 那么它会给你一条消息 说明

58
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,795
And if you don't submit the right answer,
then it will give you a message indicating

59
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:39,501
你没有完全答对

60
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:39,501
that you haven't quite gotten it right yet.

61
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:47,861
您还可以继续使用此提交密码 也可以生成新密码 都没有关系

62
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:47,861
And you can use this submission password and
you can generate new passwords; it doesn't matter.

63
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:52,556
但你也可以使用你的网站登录密码 但因为这个密码

64
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:52,556
But you can also use your regular website
login password, but because this password

65
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:59,281
会在显示器上直接显示 所以我们给你额外的提交密码

66
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:59,281
here is typed in clear text on your monitor,
we gave you this extra submission password

67
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:03,650
因为你可能不希望输入你登录网站的密码

68
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:03,650
in case you don't want to type in your
website's normal password onto a window

69
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:09,219
你的密码是否会显示出来 取决于你使用的操作系统

70
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:09,219
that, depending on your operating system,
may or may not appear as text when you type

71
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:14,544
你的密码是否会显示出来 取决于你使用的操作系统

72
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:14,544
it into the Octave submission script.

73
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:18,746
这就是提交作业的方法

74
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:18,746
So, that's how you submit the
homeworks after you've done it.

75
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:23,696
祝你好运 当你完成家庭作业的时候 我希望你都能答对

76
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:23,696
Good luck, and, when you get around to
homeworks, I hope you get all of them right.

77
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:28,329
最后 在下一个也就是最后一个 Octave 的视频教程中 我将介绍

78
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:28,329
And finally, in the next and final Octave
tutorial video, I want to tell you about

79
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:33,337
向量化(vectoriazation) 这种方式可以使你的 Octave 代码更有效率地运行

80
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:33,337
vectorization, which is a way to get your
Octave code to run much more efficiently.
