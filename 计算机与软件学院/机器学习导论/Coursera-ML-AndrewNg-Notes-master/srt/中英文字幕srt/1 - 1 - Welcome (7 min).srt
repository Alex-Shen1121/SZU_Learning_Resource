2
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:08,579
of the most exciting recent technologies.
And in this class, you learn about the
目前最激动人心的技术之一。本课程中，你将学习

3
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:13,115
state of the art and also gain practice
implementing and deploying these algorithms
机器学习的发展，并且实现这些算法。

4
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:17,487
yourself. You've probably use a learning
algorithm dozens of times a day without
你每天都要多次使用学习，但并没有意识到。

5
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:21,422
knowing it. Every time you use a web
search engine like Google or Bing to
每次当你使用Google或Bing等搜索引擎时，

6
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:25,794
search the internet, one of the reasons
that works so well is because a learning
它能给出如此满意的结果，原因之一就是使用了学习算法。

7
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:30,002
algorithm, one implemented by Google or
 Microsoft, has learned how to rank web
由Google或微软实现的算法学会如何给网页排序。

8
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:35,144
pages. Every time you use Facebook or
Apple's photo typing application and it
每次你使用Facebook或苹果的相片分类功能，

9
00:00:35,144 --> 00:00:40,595
recognizes your friends' photos, that's
also machine learning. Every time you read
它能识别出你朋友的相片，这也是机器学习。每次当你阅读邮件时，

10
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:46,054
your email and your spam filter saves you
 from having to wade through tons of spam
你的垃圾邮件过滤器帮助你过滤大量的垃圾邮件，

11
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:50,980
email, that's also a learning algorithm.
For me one of the reasons I'm excited is
这也是学习算法。对我而言，我兴奋的原因之一是

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,643
the AI dream of someday building machines
as intelligent as you or me. We're a long
AI的梦想就是有一天能建造像你我一样智能的机器。

13
00:00:55,643 --> 00:01:00,076
way away from that goal, but many AI
researchers believe that the best way to
我们离这个目标还很远，但是许多AI研究者相信实现这个目标的最好方法

14
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:04,567
towards that goal is through learning
 algorithms that try to mimic how the human
就是采用学习算法试图模拟人类大脑是如何学习的。

15
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:08,994
brain learns. I'll tell you a little bit
 about that too in this class. In this
在本课程中，我将会向你们介绍部分这方面的内容。

16
00:01:08,994 --> 00:01:13,542
class you learn about state-of-the-art
machine learning algorithms. But it turns
本课程中，你将学习机器学习算法的发展。

17
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:17,919
out just knowing the algorithms and
knowing the math isn't that much good if
但是，仅知道算法以及算法的数学含义，

18
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:22,466
you don't also know how to actually get
this stuff to work on problems that you
却不知道如何在你关心的问题上运用，是远远不够的。

19
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:26,844
care about. So, we've also spent a lot
of time developing exercises for you to
因此，我们也会花很多时间让你练习如何

20
00:01:26,844 --> 00:01:32,088
implement each of these algorithms and
 see how they work for yourself. So why is
实现每一个算法，如何被你所用。

21
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:37,075
machine learning so prevalent today?
It turns out that machine learning is a
这就是为什么机器学习如此流行。机器学习

22
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:41,713
field that had grown out of the field of
AI, or artificial intelligence. We wanted
是从AI发展出来的一个领域。我们想

23
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:46,642
to build intelligent machines and it turns
out that there are a few basic things that
建造智能机器，那就是说我们要编程使机器能做很多基本的事情，

24
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:51,454
we could program a machine to do such as
how to find the shortest path from A to B.
比如找到从A到B的最短路径。

25
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:56,267
But for the most part we just did not know
how to write AI programs to do the more

有趣的事情，如网页搜索、相片标记、反垃圾邮件。

26
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:05,718
was a realization that the only way to do
 these things was to have a machine learn
人们认识到做到这些事情，唯一的方法就是使机器本事学习如何去做。

27
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:11,237
to do it by itself. So, machine learning
was developed as a new capability for
因此，机器学习是计算机需要开发的一项新能力，
