2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,659
how to get logistic regression to
我们将谈到如何使用逻辑回归 (logistic regression)

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,089
work for multi-class classification problems,
来解决多类别分类问题

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,526
and in particular I want to
具体来说

5
00:00:07,526 --> 00:00:12,070
tell you about an algorithm called one-versus-all classification.
我想通过一个叫做"一对多" (one-vs-all) 的分类算法

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,316
What's a multi-class classification problem?
让你了解什么是多类别分类问题

7
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:15,945
Here are some examples.
先看这样一些例子

8
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:17,318
Let's say you want a learning
假如说你现在需要

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,691
algorithm to automatically put your
一个学习算法 能自动地

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,076
email into different folders or
将邮件归类到不同的文件夹里

11
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:23,398
to automatically tag your emails.
或者说可以自动地加上标签

12
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,749
So, you might have different folders
那么 你也许需要一些不同的文件夹

13
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,052
or different tags for work email,
或者不同的标签来完成这件事

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,236
email from your friends, email
来区分开来自工作的邮件、来自朋友的邮件

15
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:31,561
from your family and emails about your hobby.
来自家人的邮件或者是有关兴趣爱好的邮件

16
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,145
And so, here, we have
那么

17
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:34,856
a classification problem with 4
我们就有了

18
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,164
classes, which we might
这样一个分类问题

19
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,129
assign the numbers, the classes
其类别有四个

20
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,326
y1, y2, y3 and
分别用y=1、y=2、y=3、

21
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:43,530
y4 to, Another
y=4 来代表

22
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,790
example for a medical
另一个例子是有关药物诊断的

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,260
diagnosis: if a patient
如果一个病人

24
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,910
comes into your office with
因为鼻塞

25
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,395
maybe a stuffy nose, the possible
来到你的诊所

26
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:52,762
diagnoses could be that
他可能并没有生病

27
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,140
they're not ill, maybe that's
用 y=1 这个类别来代表

28
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,474
y1; or they have
或者患了感冒 用 y=2 来代表

29
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,026
a cold, 2; or they have the flu.
或者得了流感 y=3

30
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:00,541
And the third and final example,
第三个例子 也是最后一个例子

31
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,056
if you are using machine learning
如果你正在做有关

32
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,906
to classify the weather, you know,
天气的机器学习分类问题

33
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,299
maybe you want to decide that
那么你可能想要区分

34
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,937
the weather is sunny, cloudy, rainy
哪些天是晴天、多云、雨天、

35
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,211
or snow, or if there's gonna be snow.
或者下雪天

36
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,165
And so, in all of these
对上述所有的例子

37
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:12,808
examples, Y can take
y 可以取

38
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:14,300
on a small number of
一个很小的数值

39
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,498
discreet values, maybe 1 to
一个相对"谨慎"的数值

40
00:01:16,498 --> 00:01:17,810
3, 1 to 4 and so on, and
比如1到3、1到4或者其它数值

41
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,659
these are multi-class classification problems.
以上说的都是多类分类问题

42
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:21,904
And by the way, it doesn't really
顺便一提的是

43
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:23,632
matter whether we index as
对于下标是 0 1 2 3

44
00:01:23,632 --> 00:01:27,063
0123 or as 1234, I tend
还是 1 2 3 4 都不重要

45
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,138
to index that my classes
我更喜欢将分类

46
00:01:29,138 --> 00:01:31,569
starting from 1 rather than starting from 0.
从 1 开始标而不是 0

47
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:33,756
But either way, where often, it really doesn't matter.
其实怎样标注都不会影响最后的结果

48
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:35,243
Whereas previously, for a
然而对于之前的一个

49
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:39,375
binary classification problem, our data sets look like this.
二元分类问题 我们的数据看起来可能是像这样

50
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,617
For a multi-class classification problem, our
对于一个多类分类问题

51
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:42,792
data sets may look like
我们的数据集

52
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:44,362
this, where here, I'm using
或许看起来像这样

53
00:01:44,362 --> 00:01:48,399
three different symbols to represent our three classes.
我用三种不同的符号来代表三个类别

54
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,858
So, the question is: Given the
问题就是

55
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:51,613
data set with three classes
给出三个类型的数据集

56
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,193
where this is a the
这是一个类别中的样本

57
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:54,651
example of one class, that's
而这个样本是属于

58
00:01:54,651 --> 00:01:55,768
the example of the different class,
另一个类别

59
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,389
and, that's the example of yet, the third class.
而这个样本属于第三个类别

60
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,421
How do we get a learning algorithm to work for the setting?
我们如何得到一个学习算法来进行分类呢？

61
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,598
We already know how to
我们现在已经知道如何

62
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:05,096
do binary classification, using logistic
进行二元分类

63
00:02:05,096 --> 00:02:06,594
regression, we know how the,
可以使用逻辑斯特回归

64
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,736
you know, maybe, for the straight line,
对于直线或许你也知道

65
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:10,613
to separate the positive and negative classes.
可以将数据集一分为二为正类和负类

66
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:12,116
Using an idea called one
用一对多的

67
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:14,399
versus all classification, we can
分类思想

68
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,730
then take this, and, make
我们可以

69
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,646
it work for multi-class classification, as well.
将其用在多类分类问题上

70
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,617
Here's how one versus all classification works.
下面将介绍如何进行一对多的分类工作

71
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,777
And, this is also sometimes called "one versus rest."
有时这个方法也被称为"一对余"方法

72
00:02:25,777 --> 00:02:26,941
Let's say, we have a training
现在我们有一个训练集

73
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:28,138
set, like that shown on the
好比左边表示的

74
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,456
left, where we have 3 classes.
有三个类别

75
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,310
So, if y1, we denote that
我们用三角形表示 y=1

76
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,405
with a triangle if y2 the
方框表示 y=2

77
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,970
square and, if y3 then, the cross.
叉叉表示 y=3

78
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,460
What we're going to do is,
我们下面要做的就是

79
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,350
take a training set, and, turn
使用一个训练集

80
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,816
this into three separate binary classification problems.
将其分成三个二元分类问题

81
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:46,719
So, I'll turn this into three separate
所以我将它分成三个

82
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,450
two class classification problems.
二元分类问题

83
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,660
So let's start with Class 1, which is a triangle.
我们先从用三角形代表的类别1开始

84
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,990
We are going to essentially create a
实际上我们可以创建一个

85
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,418
new, sort of fake training set.
新的"伪"训练集

86
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,913
where classes 2 and 3
类型2和类型3

87
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,151
get assigned to the negative
定为负类

88
00:02:58,151 --> 00:02:59,873
class and class 1
类型1

89
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:01,134
gets assigned to the positive class
设定为正类

90
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:02,352
when we create a new training
我们创建一个新的

91
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,700
set if that's showing
训练集

92
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,508
on the right and we're going
如右侧所示的那样

93
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:07,573
to fit a classifier, which I'm
我们要拟合出一个合适的分类器

94
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:10,200
going to call h subscript theta
我们称其为

95
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,626
superscript 1 of x
h 下标 θ 上标(1) (x)

96
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,659
where here, the triangles
这里的三角形是正样本

97
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,008
are the positive examples and the circles are the negative examples.
而圆形代表负样本

98
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:20,649
So, think of the triangles be
可以这样想

99
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:21,800
assigned the value of 1
设置三角形的值为1

100
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,291
and the circles the sum, the value of zero.
圆形的值为0

101
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,723
And we're just going to train
下面我们来训练一个标准的

102
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:29,556
a standard logistic regression crossfire
逻辑回归分类器

103
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:34,173
and maybe that will give us a position boundary.
这样我们就得到一个正边界

104
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:34,173
OK?
对吧?

105
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,693
The superscript 1 here is the class one.
这里上标(1)表示类别1

106
00:03:37,693 --> 00:03:40,777
So, we're doing this for the triangle first class.
我们可以像这样对三角形类别这么做

107
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,302
Next, we do the same thing for class 2.
下面 我们将为类别2做同样的工作

108
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:44,013
Going to take the squares and
取这些方块样本

109
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,456
assign the squares as the
然后将这些方块

110
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,001
positive class and assign
作为正样本

111
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:50,213
every thing else the triangles and the crosses as the negative class.
设其它的为三角形和叉形类别为负样本

112
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,173
and then we fit a second logistic regression classifier.
这样我们找到第二个合适的逻辑回归分类器

113
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:56,410
I'm gonna call this H of X
我们称为 h 下标 θ 上标(2) (x)

114
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,352
superscript 2, where the
其中上标(2)表示

115
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:00,029
superscript 2 denotes that
是类别2

116
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:01,860
we're now doing this:  treating the
所以我们做的就是

117
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,310
square class as the positive
把方块类当做正样本

118
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,518
class and maybe we get the classifier like that.
我们可能便会得到这样的一个分类器

119
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:08,854
And finally, we do the
最后 同样地

120
00:04:08,854 --> 00:04:10,143
same thing for the third
我们对第三个类别采用同样的方法

121
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:11,598
class and fit a third
并找出

122
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,632
classifier H superscript 3
第三个分类器 h 下标 θ 上标(3) (x)

123
00:04:14,632 --> 00:04:16,424
of X and maybe this
或许这么做

124
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,106
will give us a decision boundary
可以给出一个像这样的

125
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:19,749
or give us a classifier that separates
判别边界

126
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,863
the positive and negative examples like that.
或者说分类器 能这样分开正负样本

127
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,353
So, to summarize, what we've
总而言之

128
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:27,872
done is we fit 3 classifiers.
我们已经拟合出三个分类器

129
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,403
So, for I equals 1
对于 i 等于1、2、3

130
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,836
2 3 we'll fit a classifier
我们都找到了一个分类器

131
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,855
H superscript I subscript theta
h 上标(i) 下标θ 括号 x

132
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:35,193
of X, thus trying to
通过这样来尝试

133
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,446
estimate what is the
估计出

134
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,208
probability that y is
给出 x 和先验 θ 时

135
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,834
equal to class I given X and prioritize by theta.
y的值等于 i 的概率

136
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:41,834
Right?
对么？

137
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:43,229
So, in the first
在一开始

138
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,903
instance, for this first one
对于第一个在这里的

139
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,277
up here, this classifier
分类器

140
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,364
with learning to by the triangle.
完成了对三角形的识别

141
00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:52,037
So it's thinking of the triangles as a positive class.
把三角形当做是正类别

142
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,840
So, X superscript one is
所以 h(1) 实际上是在计算

143
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,163
essentially trying to estimate what is
给定x 以 θ 为参数时

144
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,343
the probability that the Y
y的值为1的

145
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,083
is equal to one, given
概率是多少

146
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:02,037
X and parametrized by theta.
概率是多少

147
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:04,475
And similarly, this is treating,
同样地 这个也是这么处理

148
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,859
you know, the square class as
矩形类型当做一个正类别

149
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:07,400
a positive took pause so its
同样地

150
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,748
trying to estimate the probability that y2 and so on.
可以计算出 y=2 的概率和其它的概率值来

151
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,300
So we now have 3 classifiers each
现在我们便有了三个分类器

152
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,649
of which was trained is one of the three crosses.
且每个分类器都作为其中一种情况进行训练

153
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,859
Just to summarize, what we've
总之

154
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,685
done is we've, we want
我们已经把要做的做完了

155
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,280
to train a logistic regression
现在要做的就是训练这个

156
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,560
classifier, H superscript I
逻辑回归分类器 h(i)

157
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,947
of X, for each plus
逻辑回归分类器 h(i)

158
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,183
i that predicts it's probably a
其中 i 对应每一个可能的 y=i

159
00:05:26,183 --> 00:05:28,550
y i. Finally, to
最后

160
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,740
make a prediction when we
为了做出预测

161
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,772
give it a new input x and
我们给出输入一个新的 x 值

162
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:33,326
we want to make a prediction,
用这个做预测

163
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,729
we do is we just
我们要做的

164
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,706
run Let's say three
就是

165
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:38,557
what run our 3 of our
在我们三个分类器

166
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:40,010
classifiers on the input
里面输入 x

167
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,535
x and we then
然后

168
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:44,068
pick the class i that maximizes the three.
我们选择一个让 h 最大的 i

169
00:05:44,068 --> 00:05:45,387
So, we just you know, basically
你现在知道了

170
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,180
pick the classifier, pick whichever
基本的挑选分类器的方法

171
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,163
one of the three classifiers is
选择出哪一个分类器是

172
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,178
most confident, or most enthusistically
可信度最高效果最好的

173
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:54,352
says that it thinks it has a right class.
那么就可认为得到一个正确的分类

174
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:56,153
So, whichever value of i
无论i值是多少

175
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,069
gives us the highest probability, we
我们都有最高的概率值

176
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:01,056
then predict y to be that value.
我们预测 y 就是那个值

177
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,453
So, that's it for multi-class
这就是多类别分类问题

178
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,677
classification and one-versus-all method.
以及一对多的方法

179
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:09,120
And with this little method
通过这个小方法

180
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,521
you can now take the logistic
你现在也可以将

181
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:12,033
regression classifier and make
逻辑回归分类器

182
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:15,051
it work on multi-class classification problems as well.
用在多类分类的问题上
