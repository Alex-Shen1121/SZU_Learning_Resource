9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,640
And in this video I'd like
在这个视频中，我想

10
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,850
to give you some guidelines,
给你们一些指引，

11
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,090
tell you about how people
告诉你们一般情况下人们

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,490
tend to think about how to
如何考虑

13
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,740
choose this parameter K for PCA.
选取这个参数K。

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,670
In order to choose k,
为了选择K，

15
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:30,990
that is to choose the number
即选择这个主成分的

16
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,110
of principal components, here are a couple of useful concepts.
数字，这里有几个有用的概念。

17
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,520
What PCA tries to do
PCA试图

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
is it tries to minimize
去减少

19
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,510
the average squared projection error.
投影误差平方的平均值。

20
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,200
So it tries to minimize
因此，它试图减少

21
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,480
this quantity, which I'm writing down,
这个数量，就是我正在写的这个，

22
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,980
which is the difference between the
它是

23
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,010
original data X and the
原始数据X和

24
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,470
projected version, X-approx-i, which
投影，X约-i(上个视频中定义）

25
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,930
was defined last video, so
所以

26
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,900
it tries to minimize the squared
它试图尽量减少

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,360
distance between x and it's projection
x和x在低维面的投影

28
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,750
onto that lower dimensional surface.
距离的差的平方

29
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,990
So that's the average square projection error.
所以这是投影误差平方的平均值。

30
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,320
Also let me define the
同时我也将定义

31
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,020
total variation in the
数据的总方差

32
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,730
data to be the
为样本X的平方和

33
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,730
average length squared of
的平均值

34
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,130
these examples Xi

35
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,010
so the total variation in the
所以数据的

36
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,930
data is the average of
总方差就是

37
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,250
my training sets of the
我的训练集中

38
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,640
length of each of my training examples.
每个训练样本的平均长度

39
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,690
And this one says, "On average, how
这个说明了：“平均来说，

40
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,850
far are my training examples
我的训练样本

41
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,960
from the vector, from just being all zeros?"
距离全零向量的距离“

42
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,460
How far is, how far
或者说，我的训练样本

43
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,820
on average are my training examples from the origin?
距离原点有多远？

44
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,450
When we're trying to choose k, a
当我们试图选择K，

45
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,210
pretty common rule of thumb
一个常见的

46
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,620
for choosing k is to choose
经验方法是

47
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,290
the smaller values so that
选择较小的值，

48
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,810
the ratio between these is less than 0.01.
使得这两者之间的比值小于0.01。

49
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,540
So in other words,
换句话说，

50
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,370
a pretty common way to
一个很常见的方式，

51
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,460
think about how we choose k
来选择K

52
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,180
is we want the average squared projection error.
是我们想让平均投影误差平方

53
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,700
That is the average distance
即x和其投影的

54
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,340
between x and it's projections
平均距离

55
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,330
divided by the total variation of the data.
除以数据的总方差（

56
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,870
That is how much the data varies.
数据的波动程度）。

57
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,060
We want this ratio to be
我们希望这个比例

58
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,760
less than, let's say, 0.01.
比如说，小于0.01

59
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,450
Or to be less than 1%, which is another way of thinking about it.
或小于1％，这是另一种表述方式。

60
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,940
And the way most people think
而且大多数人

61
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,640
about choosing K is rather
选择K

62
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,660
than choosing K directly the
并不是像多数人谈论的那样

63
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,110
way most people talk about
直接进行选择

64
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,940
it is as what this
这是因为这个数

65
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,630
number is, whether it is 0.01
无论是0.01

66
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,330
or some other number.
或一些其它数字。

67
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,320
And if it is 0.01, another way
如果是0.01，另一种方式，

68
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,020
to say this to use the
用PCA的语言来表述，

69
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,120
language of PCA is that 99% of the variance is retained.
就是99％的方差性会被保留。

70
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,480
I don't really want to, don't
不必担心

71
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,810
worry about what this phrase
这个短语

72
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,920
really means technically but this
的真正含义，这个

73
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,170
phrase "99% of variance is retained" just means
短语“99％的方差会被保留”只是说

74
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,710
that this quantity on the left is less than 0.01.
左侧的这个量小于0.01

75
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,910
And so, if you
所以，如果你

76
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,510
are using PCA and if you want
使用主成分分析，如果你想

77
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,730
to tell someone, you know,
告诉别人，

78
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,860
how many principle components you've
你保留了多少主成分

79
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,080
retained it would be
这样去表述会

80
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,360
more common to say well, I
比较好，我

81
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,360
chose k so that 99% of the variance was retained.
选择k使得99％的方差被保留。

82
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,960
And that's kind of a useful thing
这是一个需要知道的有用的

83
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,530
to know, it means that you
东西，这意味着你

84
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,820
know, the average squared projection
知道，平均投影误差平方

85
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,720
error divided by the total
除以数据总方差，

86
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,260
variation that was at most 1%.
结果不会超过1%。

87
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,770
That's kind of an insightful
这样的表述方式是很有见地

88
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,790
thing to think about, whereas if
的，否则

89
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,420
you tell someone that, "Well I
你告诉别人，“嗯，我

90
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,710
had to 100 principle
有100主成分

91
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,030
components" or "k was equal
或”在1000维的数据中

92
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,850
to 100 in a thousand dimensional
k等于100“

93
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,350
data" it's a little
这对于

94
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,600
hard for people to interpret
人们来说

95
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,100
that.
不太好理解

96
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,220
So this number 0.01 is what people often use.
因此这个数字0.01是人们经常使用的东西。

97
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,380
Other common values is 0.05,
其他常见的值是0.05，

98
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,810
and so this would be 5%,
因此，这将是5％，

99
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,870
and if you do that then
如果你这样做，那么

100
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,390
you go and say well 95%
你会说95％的

101
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,320
of the variance is
方差

102
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,280
retained and, you know
会保留，你知道

103
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,710
other numbers maybe 90% of the variance is
其它数字也许90％的方差被

104
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,030
retained, maybe as low as 85%.
保留，也许低至85％。

105
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,410
So 90% would correspond to say
因此，90％将对应于说

106
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,950
0.10, kinda 10%.
0.10，或10％。

107
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,160
And so range of values
所以，值的范围从

108
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,770
from, you know, 90, 95,
90，95，

109
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,470
99, maybe as low as 85% of
99，也许低至85％

110
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,100
the variables contained would be a fairly typical range in values.
都是一些具有代表性的范围。

111
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,900
Maybe 95 to 99
也许95到99

112
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,810
is really the most
是真正最

113
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,080
common range of values that people use.
对被使用的范围

114
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,950
For many data sets you'd be
对于许多数据集你会

115
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,320
surprised, in order to retain

118
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,810
the data significantly and still retain most of the variance.
但仍保留大部分的方差。

119
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,410
Because for most real life
因为对于真实世界的数据

120
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,210
data says many features are
来说，许多特征都

121
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,060
just highly correlated, and so
是高度相关的，因此

122
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:17,940
it turns out to be possible
结果证明：

123
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,540
to compress the data a
对数据进行

124

or 95% of the variance. So how do you implement this?
或95％的方差。那么，你如何实现呢？

127
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,610
Well, here's one algorithm that you might use.
那么，这里提供一个你可能会用到的算法。

128
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,360
You may start off, if you
你可以开始了，如果你

129
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,360
want to choose the value of
要选择K的值，

130
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,510
k, we might start off with k equals 1.
我们开始可以给K赋值1

131
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,670
And then we run through PCA.
然后我们运行PCA算法

132
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,440
You know, so we compute, you
然后我们计算，你

133
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,880
reduce, compute z1, z2, up to zm.
减少，计算Z1，Z2，一直到ZM。

Compute all of those x1 approx
计算所有这些X1-approx

135
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,540
approx and so on up to xm approx
到 XM-approx

136
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,110
and then we check if 99% of the variance is retained.
然后我们检查，是否保留了99％的方差。

137
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,890
Then we're good and we use k equals 1.
如果保留了，那么我们让K等于1。

138
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,960
But if it isn't then what we'll do we'll next try K equals 2.
但如果不是，那么我们将做什么，我们接下来会尝试让K等于2。

139
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,810
And then we'll again
然后我们将再次

140
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,070
run through this entire procedure and
运行PCA算法，

141
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,770
check, you know is this expression satisfied.
检查一下，是否满足表达式。

142
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,980
Is this less than 0.01. And if not then we do this again.
是否小于0.01。如果没有的话，我们重复这个步骤。

143
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,070
Let's try k equals 3,
让我们试着让k等于3，

144
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,910
then try k equals 4,

145
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,250
and so on until maybe
依此类推，直至也许

146
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,730
we get up to k equals

147
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,040
17 and we find 99% of
17，我们发现99％的

148
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,060
the data have is retained and then

149
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,110
we use k equals 17, right?
我们使得k等于17，对吗？

150
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,160
That is one way

151
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,790
to choose the smallest value

152
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,920
of k, so that and 99% of the variance is retained.
从而使99％的方差被保留。

153
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,440
But as you can imagine,
但正如你可以想像的，

154
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,140
this procedure seems horribly inefficient

we're trying k equals one, k equals two, we're doing all these calculations.
我们尝试让k等于1，k等于2，我们正在做的所有这些计算。

156
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,540
