Let's start talking about logistic regression.
让我们开始谈谈逻辑回归 (字幕整理：中国海洋大学 黄海广,haiguang2000@qq.com )

00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,315
In this video, I'd like to
在这段视频中 我将要

3
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:07,210
show you the hypothesis representation, that
向你展示表征假设 也就是

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,805
is, what is the function

5
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,266
we're going to use to represent

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,446
our hypothesis where we have a classification problem.
我们的假设 我们有一个分类问题

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,969
Earlier, we said that we
此前 我们说我们

8
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:20,426
would like our classifier to

10
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:23,250
zero and one. So, we
因此 我们

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,566
like to come up with a

14
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:32,764
When we were using linear regression,
当我们使用线性回归的时候

15
00:00:32,764 --> 00:00:34,262
this was the form of a

16
00:00:34,262 --> 00:00:35,604
hypothesis, where H of X

18
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,831
logistic regression, I'm going
逻辑回归 我要去

19
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,075
to modify this a little
修改这一点

20
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,352
bit, and make the hypothesis

27
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,480
E to the negative Z. This

28
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,716
called the sigmoid function
称为S形函数

29
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,843
or the logistic function.
或逻辑函数

30
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:07,089
And the term logistic function,
而长期的逻辑功能，

31
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,103
that's what give rise to the name logistic progression.
就是引起逻辑进程的名称

32
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:12,781
And, by the way, the terms
而且 顺便说一下 这个术语

33
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,551
sigmoid function and logistic
S型函数和逻辑

34
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:16,996
function are basically synonyms
函数基本上是同义词

35
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:18,362
and mean the same thing.
和意味着同样的事情

36
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:19,756
So the two terms are
因此 这两个术语是

37
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:21,893
basically interchangeable and either
基本上是可互换的 要么其他

38
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:23,160
term can be used to
术语可以用来

39
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,620
refer to this function
参阅此函数

40
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,283
G. And if we
G 如果我们

41
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:27,734
take these two equations, and
使这两个方程 并

42
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:30,089
put them together, then here's
把它们放在一起 那么这里

43
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:32,354
just an alternative way of
正好是一个替代

44
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:34,843
writing out the form of my hypothesis.
我的假设写出来的方式

45
00:01:34,843 --> 00:01:36,533
I'm saying that H of x
我说H的x

46
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,933
is one over one plus
是一分之一加

47
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,765
E to the negative theta transpose
E的负θ转换

48
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:43,106
X, and all I've done is
X 我愿付出一切

49
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:45,353
I've taken the variable
我已经采取变量

50
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:46,700
Z, Z here's a
Z Z是一个

51
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,173
real number and plugged in
实数和插入

52
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:50,201
theta transpose X, so
θ转换X，所以

53
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:52,560
I end up with, you know, theta transpose
我最终 你知道 θ转换

54
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,933
X, in place of Z there.
X 在Z轴上

55
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,949
Lastly, let me show you where the sigmoid function looks like.
最后，来让我向你展示S型函数

56
00:01:57,949 --> 00:02:00,296
We're going to plot it on this figure here.
我们要在这绘制这个图形

57
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:02,022
The sigmoid function, G of
S型函数 G的

58
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,652
Z, also called the logistic function, looks like this.
Z 也称为逻辑函数 看起来是这样的

59
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:07,078
It starts off near zero and
它开始接近零

60
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:09,366
then rises until it processes
然后上升 直到

61
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:13,473
0.5 at the origin and then it flattens out again like so.
0.5在原点 那么它再次变平了 像这样

62
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,051
So that's what the sigmoid function looks like.
所以S型函数看起来像

63
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:17,898
And you notice that the
而且你注意到

64
00:02:17,898 --> 00:02:19,725
sigmoid function, well, it
S型函数 那么 它

65
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,894
asymptotes at one, and
在一个渐近线上

66
00:02:21,894 --> 00:02:24,256
asymptotes at zero as
渐近于零

67
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:26,388
Z against the horizontal axis
?的水平轴

68
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:27,659
is Z. As Z goes to
为Z Z的

69
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:29,304
minus infinity, G of
负无穷大 G

70
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:31,396
Z approaches zero and as
的z接近零和

71
00:02:31,396 --> 00:02:33,816
G of Z approaches infinity, G
G的?趋于无穷大时 G

72
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:35,864
of Z approaches 1, and
的z接近1

73
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,252
so because G of
因为G的

74
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:39,408
Z offers values that are
?值在

75
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:41,696
between 0 and 1 we
0和1之间 我们

76
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,592
also have that H of
也使得H的

77
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,141
X must be between 0 and 1.
X必须为0和1之间

78
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:50,029
Finally, given this hypothesis
最后 鉴于这一假说

79
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,123
representation, what we
表示 什么是我们

80
00:02:52,123 --> 00:02:53,740
need to do, as before,
需要做的 因为在此之前

81
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,841
is fit the parameters theta to our data.
是适合我们的数据参数θ

82
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:00,490
So given a training set, we
所以一个训练集 我们

83
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,743
need to pick a value for
需要选择一个值

84
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:03,773
the parameters theta and this
参数θ和这个

85
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:06,981
hypothesis will then let us make predictions.
假设会让我们做出预测

86
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:08,534
We'll talk about a learning algorithm
稍后我们将谈论一个学习算法

87
00:03:08,534 --> 00:03:11,828
later for fitting the parameters theta.
拟合参数θ

88
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:13,506
But first let's talk a
但是首先让我们讨论

89
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:17,379
bit about the interpretation of this model.
一下这个模型的解释

90
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,612
Here's how I'm going to

97
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,170
is equal to one on a

99
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:40,324
Here is an example.
下面就是一个例子

100
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:43,932
Let's say we're using the tumor classification example.
比方说 我们正在使用的肿瘤分类的例子

101
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,234
So we may have a feature

103
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:49,860
as always and then our
和平时一样 然后我们

104
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,836
one feature is the size of the tumor.
的一个特征是肿瘤的大小

105
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:54,045
Suppose I have a patient come

129
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,389
So, for those of you that are

130
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:45,320
familiar with probability, this equation
熟悉概率 这个方程

131
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,766
might make sense, if you're a little less familiar

132
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:48,673
with probability, you know, here's
概率 要知道 这里是

133
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:51,564
how I read this expression, this
我怎么看这个表达式 这

134
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,215
is the probability that y is
是y的概率是

135
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:54,988
equals to one, given x
等于一 鉴于x

136
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:56,493
instead of given that my patient
而不是考虑我的病人

137
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:58,027
has, you know, features X.
你知道 假设X

138
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,860
Given my patient has a particular
鉴于我的病人有一个特别的

139
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,575
tumor size represented by my
肿瘤大小代表我的

140
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:03,156
features X, and this
假设X 这

141
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:06,956
probability is parametrized by theta.
参数化的概率θ

142
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,166
So I'm basically going to count

143
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,009
on my hypothesis to give
我假设给

144
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:13,332

00:05:16,523 --> 00:05:18,629
classification task, we know

So given H of X,
