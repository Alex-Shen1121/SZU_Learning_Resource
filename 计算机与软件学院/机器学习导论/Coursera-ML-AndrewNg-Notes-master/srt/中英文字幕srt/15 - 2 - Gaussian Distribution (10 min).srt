00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,410
In this video, I'd like to
在这个视频中
(字幕整理：中国海洋大学 黄海广,haiguang2000@qq.com )

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,590
talk about the Gaussian distribution, which
我将介绍高斯分布

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,810
is also called the normal distribution.
也称为正态分布

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,940
In case you're already intimately
如果你已经

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,980
familiar with the Gaussian distribution, it is
对高斯分布非常熟悉了

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,810
probably okay to skip this video.
那么也许你可以直接跳过这段视频

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,890
But if you're not sure or
但是 如果你不确定

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,890
if it's been a while since you've
或者你已经有段时间

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,770
worked with a Gaussian distribution or the normal
没有接触高斯分布

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,480
distribution then please do
或者正态分布了

11
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,960
watch this video all the way to the end.
那么 请从头到尾看完这段视频

12
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,260
And in the video after this,
在下一个视频中

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,740
we'll start applying the Gaussian
我们将应用高斯分布

14
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,890
distribution to developing an anomaly detection algorithm.
来推导一套异常检测算法

15
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,310
Let's say x is a
假设x是一个

16
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,470
real value random variable, so x is a real number.
实数随机变量 因此x是一个实数

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,080
If the probability distribution of
如果x的概率分布

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,160
x is Gaussian, it
服从高斯分布

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,710
would mean Mu and variant
其中均值为μ

20
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,360
sigma squared, then we'll
方差为σ平方

21
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,600
write this as x the
那么将它记作

22
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,270
random variable tilde.
随机变量x 波浪号

23
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,300
That's this little tilde
这个小小的波浪号

24
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:59,520
as distributed as and then
读作 服从...分布

25
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,550
to denote the Gaussian Distribution, sometimes
为了表示高斯分布

26
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,930
you're going to write script n, parentheses
有时你将使用大写字母N

27
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,140
Mu, sigma squared.
括号μ σ平方

28
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,310
So, this script's end stands for
因此这个大写字母N表示

29
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,920
normal, since Gaussian and normal
Normal (正态)

30
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,170
distribution, they mean the same
因为高斯分布就是正态分布

31
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,660
phase of synonymous and a
他们是同义词

32
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,190
Gussian distribution is parameterized
然后 高斯分布

33
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,430
by 2 parameters, by a
有两个参数

34
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,930
mean parameter which we
一个是均值

35
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,770
denote Mu, and a variance
我们记作μ

36
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,010
parameter, which we denote by sigma squared.
另一个是方差 我们记作σ平方

37
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,270
If we pluck the Gaussian distribution
如果我们将高斯分布

38
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,100
or Gaussian probability density, it
的概率密度函数绘制出来

39
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,760
will look like the bell shaped
它看起来将是这样一个钟形的曲线

40
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,820
curve, which you may have seen before.
大家之前可能就见过

41
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,860
And so, this bell-shaped curve
这个钟形曲线

42
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,350
is parameterized by those 2 parameters Mu and sigma.
有两个参数 分别是μ和σ

43
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,670
And the location of the
其中μ控制

44
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,230
center of this bell-shaped curve
这个钟形曲线

45
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,960
is the mean Mu, and the
的中心位置

46
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,150
width of this bell-shaped curve,
σ控制这个钟形曲线的宽度

47
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,020
so it's roughly that, is
因此 参数σ

48
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,970
the, this parameter
有时也称作

49
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,390
sigma, is also called one standard deviation.
一个标准差

50
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,350
And so, this specifies the
这条钟形曲线决定了

51
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,630
probability of x taking
x取不同数值

52
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,990
on different values, so x
的概率密度分布

53
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,730
taking on values, you know
因此 x取中心这些值

54
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,770
in the middle here is pretty high
的概率相当大

55
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,290
since the Gaussian density here
因为高斯分布的概率密度

56
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,490
is pretty high whereas
在这里很大

57
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,540
x taking on values further and
而x取远处和更远处数值

58
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,310
further away will be diminishing
的概率将逐渐降低

59
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,600
in probability. Finally, just
直至消失

60
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,770
for completeness, let me write
最后 为了讲述的完整性

61
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,260
out the formula for the Gaussian
让我写下高斯分布的数学公式

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,310
distribution so the property
x的概率分布

63
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,780
of x and I'll
我有时不写p(x)

64
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,940
sometimes write this instead of
我会用这个代替

65
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,070
p of x, I'm going
我会写成

66
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,960
to write this as p of
p 括号 x

67
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,930
x semicolon Mu comma sigma squared.
分号 μ 逗号 σ 平方

68
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,750
And so this denotes that the probability of
这个表示

69
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,670
x is parametrized by
x的概率分布

70
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,660
the two parameters Mu and sigma squared.
由两个参数控制μ和σ平方

71
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,330
And the formula for the
高斯分布的概率密度公式

72
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,760
Gaussian density is this,
是这样的

73
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,860
1 over 2pi, sigma e
2π开方 乘以 σ 分之 1

74
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,510
to the negative x minus Mu squared over 2 sigma squared.
乘以一个e的指数函数 其中指数项为 负的 x减μ的平方除以2倍的σ平方

75
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,980
So there's no need to memorize this
其实我们并不需要

76
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,530
formula, you know, this
记住这个公式

77
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,410
is just the formula for the
它只是左边这条钟形曲线

78
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,020
bell-shaped curve over here on the left.
对应的公式

79
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,100
There's no need to memorize it and
我们没有必要记住它

80
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,990
if you ever need to use this,
当我们真的需要用到它时

81
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,460
you can always look this up.
我们总可以查资料找到它

82
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,450
And so that figure on the
如果你选定

83
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,420
left, that is what you get
μ值

84
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,100
if you take a fixed
以及σ值

85
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,200
value of Mu and a
然后绘制p(x)曲线

86
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,070
fixed value of sigma and
那么你将得到

87
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,140
you plot p of x. So this
左边这幅图

88
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,830
curve here, this is really
因此这条曲线

89
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,000
p of x plotted as a
其实就是

90
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,540
function of x, you know,
给定μ值

91
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,970
for a fixed value of Mu
以及σ平方 也就是方差值时

92
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,770
and of sigma squared sigma squared, that's called the variance.
p(x)的函数图像

93
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,270
And sometimes it's easier to think in terms of sigma.
也许有些时候我们使用σ会更方便

94
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,730
So sigma is called the
而σ被称作

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,850
standard deviation and it,
标准差

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,640
so it specifies the
它确定了

97
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,310
width of this Gaussian probability
高斯分布概率密度函数

98
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,120
density whereas the square
的宽度

99
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,490
of sigma, so sigma squared, is
而σ平方

100
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,830
called the variance. Let's look
则称作方差

101
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,980
at some examples of what the Gaussian distribution looks like.
让我们看几个高斯分布的图像

102
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,280
If Mu equals zero, sigma equals 1.
如果μ取0 σ取1

103
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,730
Then we have a Gaussian distribution
那么我们的高斯分布

104
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,000
that is centered around zero, because that's Mu.
将以0为中心 因为μ等于0

105
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,560
And the width of this Gaussian, so
而高斯分布的宽度

106
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,610
that's one standard deviation is sigma over there.
将是一个标准差 也就是σ

107
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,330
Let's look at some examples of
让我们看几个高斯分布的图像

108
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,770
Gaussians. If Mu
如果μ取0

109
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,750
is equal to zero it equals 1.
σ取1

110
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,150
Then that corresponds to a
那么这将对应

111
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,030
Gaussian distribution that is centered
一个以0为中心

112
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,380
at zero since Mu is zero.
的高斯分布

113
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,310
And the width of this Gaussian
而高斯分布的宽度

114
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,570
is Gaussian thus controlled
高斯分布的宽度

115
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,430
by sigma by that variance parameter sigma.
由标准差σ决定

116
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,390
Here's another example.
来看另一个例子

117
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,270
Let's say Mu is equal to
如果μ取0

118
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,670
zero and sigma is equal to one-half.
σ取0.5

119
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,290
So the standard deviation is
也就是说标准差

120
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,650
one-half and the variance
是0.5

121
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,550
sigma squared would therefore be
方差σ平方

122
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,600
the square of 0.5 would be 0.25.
是0.5的平方 也就是0.25

123
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,910
And in that case the Gaussian distribution,
这时候 高斯分布

124
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,040
the Gaussian probability density looks
高斯分布的概率密度函数曲线

125
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,490
like this, is also centered at zero.
会是这样的 以0为中心

126
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,410
But now the width of
然而 现在它的宽度

127
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,250
this is much smaller because
小了许多

128
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,170
the smaller variance, the
因为方差变小了

129
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,980
width of this Gaussian density
高斯密度函数的宽度

130
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,350
is roughly half as wide.
大约是之前的一半

131
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,710
But because this is a
但是 因为这是

132
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,590
probability distribution, the area under
一个概率分布

133
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,850
the curve, that is the shaded
因此曲线下的面积

134
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,790
area there, that area
这些阴影区域的积分

135
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,810
must integrate to 1.
一定是1

136
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,500
This is a property of probability distributions.
这是概率分布的一个特性

137
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,680
And so, you know, this
因此

138
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,530
is a much taller Gaussian density because
这个高斯密度曲线更高

139
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,050
it's half as wide, with
因为它只有一半宽

140
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,150
half the standard deviation, but it's twice as tall.
只有一半的标准差 但是它有两倍高

141
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,510
Another example, if sigma is
再看一个例子

142
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,540
equal to 2, then you
如果σ等于2

143
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,870
get a much fatter, or much wider Gaussian density.
那么你将得到一个更胖更宽的高斯密度曲线

144
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,090
And so here, the sigma
在这里

145
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,300
parameter controls that this
σ参数决定了

146
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,000
Gaussian density has a wider width.
曲线会更宽

147
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,180
And once again, the area under
同样的

148
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,390
the curve, that is this shaded
曲线下方的面积 这快阴影区域

149
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,720
area, you know, it always integrates to 1.
的积分一定是1

150
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,170
That's a property of probability
这是概率分布的一个特性

151
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,280
distributions, and because it's
因为它更宽

152
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,930
wider, it's also half as
因此它只有一半高

153
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,640
tall, in order to just integrate to the same thing.
这样积分才能保持不变

154
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,520
And finally, one last example would be,
最后一个例子

155
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,980
if we now changed the Mu
如果我们也改变参数μ

156
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,660
parameters as well, then instead
那么曲线

157
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,320
of being centered at zero, we
将不再以0为中心

158
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,840
now we have a Gaussian distribution
现在我们的高斯分布

159
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,810
that is centered at three, because
以3为中心

160
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,740
this shifts over the entire Gaussian distribution.
因为整个高斯分布被平移了

161
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,040
Next, lets take about the parameter estimation problem.
接下来 让我们来看参数估计问题

162
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,570
So what is the parameter estimation problem?
那么 什么是参数估计问题？

163
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,350
Let's say we have a data set
假设我们有一个数据集

164
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,180
of m examples, so x1
其中有m个样本

165
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,470
through x(m), and let's say
从x(1)到x(m)

166
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,250
each of these examples is a real number.
假设他们都是实数

167
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,520
Here in the figure, I've plotted an
在这幅图里

168
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,390
example of a data set,
我画出了整个数据集

169
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,390
so the horizontal axis is the
图中的横轴

170
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,430
x axis and, you know, I
是x轴

171
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,290
have a range of examples of x and I've just plotted them
我的样本x取值分布广泛

172
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,060
on this figure here.
我就将它们画在这里

173
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,280
And the parameter estimation problem is, let's
而参数估计问题就是

174
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,750
say I suspect that these examples
假设我猜测这些样本

175
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,160
came from a Gaussian distribution so
来自一个高斯分布的总体

176
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,560
let's say I suspect that each of my example x(i) was distributed.
假设我猜测每一个样本xi服从某个分布

177
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,930
That's what this tilde thing means.
这里的波浪号表示 服从...分布

178
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,520
Thus, I suspect that each of
因此 我猜测

179
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,220
these examples was distributed according
这里的每个样本

180
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,190
to a normal distribution or
服从正态分布

181
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,060
Gaussian distribution with some
或者高斯分布

182
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,210
parameter Mu and some parameter sigma squared.
它有两个参数 μ和σ平方

183
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,560
But I don't know what the values of these parameters are.
然而 我不知道这些参数的值是多少

184
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,360
The problem with parameter estimation is,
参数估计问题就是

185
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,480
given my data set I want
给定数据集

186
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,720
to figure out, I want to
我希望能找到

187
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,840
estimate, what are the
能够估算出

188
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,470
values of Mu and sigma squared.
μ和σ平方的值

189
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,570
So, if you're given a
因此 如果你有

190
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,660
data set like this, you know,
这样一个数据

191
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,050
it looks like maybe, if I
它看起来好像

192
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,210
estimate what Gaussian distribution the
如果我试图找到

193
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,010
data came from, maybe that
它来自哪个高斯分布

194
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,770
might be roughly the Gaussian distribution
也许这个就是

195
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,410
it came from, with Mu
它对应的高斯分布

196
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,350
being the center of the distribution and
其中μ对应分布函数的中心

197
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,680
sigma the standard deviation controlling the width of this Gaussian distribution.
而标准差σ控制高斯分布的宽度

198
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,820
It seems like a reasonable
这条曲线似乎

199
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,280
fit to the data, because, you know, it
很好的拟合了数据

200
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,880
looks the data has
因为看起来

201
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,910
a very high probability of being
这个数据集

202
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,590
in the central region, low probability of
在中心区域的概率比较大

203
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,720
being further out, low probability of being further out, and so on.
而在外围 在边缘的概率越来越小

204
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,770
And so, maybe this is
因此 也许这是

205
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,360
a reasonable estimate of
对μ和σ平方

206
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,920
Mu and of sigma squared,
的一个不错的估计

207
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,810
that is, if it corresponds to
也就是说

208
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,970
a Gaussian distribution, that then looks like this.
我们的数据对应这样一个高斯分布

209
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,340
So, what I'm going to
那么 接下来

210
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,550
do is write out the
我将写下

211
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,090
formulas, the standard formulas
对μ和σ平方

212
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,920
for estimating the parameters from
进行参数估计的

213
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,480
Mu and sigma squared.
标准公式

214
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,860
The way we are going to
我们估计μ的方法是

215
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,140
estimate Mu is going to
对我的

216
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,850
be just the average
所有样本

217
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,630
of my example.
求平均值

218
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,190
So Mu is the mean parameter,
μ就是平均值参数

219
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,340
so I'm going to take my
因此 我将

220
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,350
training set, take my m
使用我的训练集

221
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,200
examples and average them.
使用我的m个样本 对它们取平均

222
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,120
And that just gives me the center of this distribution.
这样我就得到了高斯分布的中心位置

223
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:01,670
How about sigma squared?
那么如何估计σ平方呢？

224
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,110
Well the variance, I'll just
σ平方表示方差

225
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,890
write out the standard formula again,
我们也来写下方差的标准计算公式

226
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,780
I'm going to estimate as sum
我先将所有的样本

227
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,900
of 1 through m of x(i),
从x(1)到x(m)

228
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,730
minus Mu squared,
减去平均值μ

229
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,130
and so this Mu here is
平方再求和

230
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,030
actually the Mu that I compute
实际上μ是用

231
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,580
over here using this formula,
之前的这个公式计算出来的

232
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,920
and what the variance is, or
而方差的含义

233
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,890
one interpretation of the variance,
至少一种方差的定义

234
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,230
is that, if you look at the
是将这一项

235
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,580
this term, that's the square
所有样本

236
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,580
difference between the value
的差值平方和

237
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,190
I've got in my example minus
我已经将样本减去了平均值

238
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,300
the mean, minus the center, minus the mean of distribution.
减去了中心位置 分布的平均值

239
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,690
And so, you know, the
因此 你看

240
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,630
variance, I'm gonna estimate
我会将方差估计为

241
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,530
as just the average of
样本减去平均值

242
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,520
the square differences, between my examples, minus the mean.
差值取平方 再求平均

243
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,370
And as a side comment,
这里顺便提一下

244
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,150
only for those of you that are experts
你们有些人

245
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,820
in statistics, if you're
可能精通统计学

246
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,690
an expert in statistics and if
如果你是统计方面的专家

247
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,570
you've heard of maximum likelihood estimation,
听说过极大似然估计

248
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,950
then these estimates are actually the
那么这里的估计

249
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,530
maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters
实际就是对μ和σ平方

250
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,590
of Mu and sigma squared.
的极大似然估计

251
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,260
But if you haven't heard of that before, don't worry about it.
不过如果你没听说过这些 没关系

252
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,500
All you need to know is that
你只需要知道

253
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,880
these are the two standard formulas
这里有两个标准公式

254
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,090
for how you try to
给定数据集 你可以利用它们

255
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,820
figure out what our Mu and sigma squared given the dataset.
估算出μ和σ平方的值

256
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,140
Finally one last side comment.
最后 再提一句

257
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,810
Again only for those of
同样是针对那些

258
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,520
you that has maybe taken a statistics class before.
学习过统计课程的人

259
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,040
But if you have taken a statistics
如果你以前上过统计课程

260
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,530
class before, some of you
你们可能会见过

261
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,620
may have seen the formula here
这么一个公式

262
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,810
where, you know, this is m minus
在这里不是m

263
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,300
1, instead of m. So
而是m减1

264
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,310
this first term becomes 1
第一项写成

265
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,410
over m minus 1, instead
m减1分之1

266
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,640
of 1 over m. In machine
而不是m分之1

267
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,170
learning, people tend to use this 1 over m formula.
在机器学习领域 大家喜欢用m分之1

268
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,230
But in practice, whether it
然而在实际使用中

269
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,480
is 1 over m or 1
到底是选择使用

270
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,710
over m minus one, makes essentially
m分之1还是m减1分之1

271
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,290
no difference, assuming, you know, m is
其实区别很小

272
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,670
reasonably large, it's a large training set size.
只要你有一个还算大的训练集

273
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,480
So, just in case you've seen
因此 如果你见过m减1分之1

274
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,570
this other version before, in either
这个版本的公式

275
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,970
version it works just equally
它同样可以很好的估计出参数

276
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,630
well, but in machine
只是在机器学习领域

277
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,850
learning most people tend to
大部分人更习惯使用

278
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,410
use 1 over m in this formula.
m分之1这个版本的公式

279
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,740
And the two versions have slightly
这两个版本的公式

280
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,770
different theoretical properties, slightly different
在理论特性和数学特性上稍有不同

281
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,530
mathematical properties, but in
但是在实际使用中

282
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,080
practice it really makes very little difference, if any.
他们的区别甚小 几乎可以忽略不计

283
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,670
So, hopefully, you now have
现在 我想

284
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,900
a good sense of what the
你大概已经对高斯分布的样子

285
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,410
Gaussian distribution looks like,
有些感觉了

286
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,210
as well as how to estimate
你也知道

287
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,730
the parameters, mu and sigma
如何估计高斯分布中的

288
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,770
squared, of the Gaussian distribution, and
参数μ和σ平方

289
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,510
if you're given a training set,
只要你有一个训练集

290
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,940
that is if you're given a
如果你猜测它

291
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,220
set of data that you suspect
来自一个高斯分布

292
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,350
comes from a Gaussian
你就可以估计出它的参数值

293
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,190
distribution with unknown parameters using sigma squared.
μ和σ平方

294
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,510
In the next video, we'll start
在下一个视频中

295
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,820
to take this and apply it
我们将利用这些知识

296
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,810
to develop the anomaly detection algorithm.
推导出异常检测算法
