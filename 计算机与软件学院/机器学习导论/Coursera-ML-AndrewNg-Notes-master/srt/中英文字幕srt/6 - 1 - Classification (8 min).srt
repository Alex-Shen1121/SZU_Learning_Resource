you could try doing is then

93
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,760
threshold the classifier outputs at 0.5.

94
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,880
That is at the vertical access value 0.5.

如果它小于0.5，你预测y等于为零。

99
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,540
Let's see what happens when we do that.
让我们来看看，当我们这样做会发生什么。

So, let's take 0.5, and
所以，让我们取0.5，和

101
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,670
so, you know, that's where the threshold is.
所以，你知道，这就是门槛。

102
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,260
And thus, using linear regression this way.
