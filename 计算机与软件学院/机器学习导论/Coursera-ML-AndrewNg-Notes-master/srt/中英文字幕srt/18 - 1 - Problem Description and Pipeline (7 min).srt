So, let's start by talking about what is the Photo OCR problem.
好的 那么我们就从介绍什么是照片OCR问题开始

34
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,710
Photo OCR stands for

51
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,540
image so that if you're

55
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,910
and have it automatically pull

56
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,190
up this picture, so that
找出这张照片来

57
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,890
you're not spending lots of
这样你就不用花几个小时

58
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,130
time digging through your photo

thousands of pictures in.
把这张找出来

61
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,100
The Photo OCR problem
照片OCR就是解决这一问题的

62
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,080
does exactly this, and it does so in several steps.
它有如下几个步骤

63
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,790
First, given the picture it
首先 给定某张图片

64
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,800
has to look through the image

65
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,680
and detect where there is text in the picture.
然后找出这张图片中哪里有文字信息

66
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,960
And after it has done
在完成这一步以后

67
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,340
that or if it successfully does
成功找出有文字的位置以后

68
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,750
that it then has to
接下来要做的就是

69
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,020
look at these text regions and
重点关注这些文字区域

70
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,530
actually read the text in
并且在这些区域中

71
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,150
those regions, and hopefully if
对文字内容进行识别

72
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,670
it reads it correctly, it'll come
如果能正确读出的话

73
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,440
up with these transcriptions of
它会将这些内容进行转录

74
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,710
what is the text that appears in the image.
记录下图片中出现的这些文本

75
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,160
Whereas OCR, or optical
虽然现在OCR

76
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,850
character recognition of scanned
或者说光学文字识别

77
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,760
documents is relatively easier
对扫描的文档来说已经是一个

78
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,840
problem, doing OCR from
比较简单的问题了

79
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,480
photographs today is still a
但对于数码照片来说

80
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,970
very difficult machine learning problem,
现在还是一个比较困难的机器学习问题

81
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,730
and you can do this.
研究这个目的

82
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,320
Not only can this help
不仅仅是因为

83
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,390
our computers to understand the
这可以让计算机

84
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,380
content of our though
通过拍摄的数码相片

85
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,030
images better, there are
更好地理解我们所处的环境

86
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
also applications like helping blind
更重要的是 它衍生了很多应用

87
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,900
people, for example, if you
比如在帮助盲人方面

88
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,010
could provide to a blind person
假如你能为盲人提供一种照相机

89
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,210
a camera that can look
这种相机可以“看见”

90
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,430
at what's in front of
他们前面有什么东西

91
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,700
them, and just tell them the
可以告诉他们

92
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,990
words that my be on
面前的路牌上

93
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,830
the street sign in front of them.
写的是什么字

94
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,780
With car navigation systems.
现在也有研究人员将照片OCR技术应用到汽车导航系统中

95
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,750
For example, imagine if your
想象一下你的车

96
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,900
car could read the street
能读出街道的标识

97
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,480
signs and help you navigate to your destination.
并且将你导航至目的地

98
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,260
In order to perform photo OCR, here's what we can do.
要实现照片OCR 我们可以这样做

99
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:08,840
First we can go through the
首先我们可以通览图像

100
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,490
image and find the regions where there's text and image.
并找出有文字的图像区域

101
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,380
So, shown here is
这里展示的例子就是

102
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,430
one example of text and
照片OCR系统可能会识别到的

103
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,700
image that the photo OCR system may find.
图像中的文字信息

104
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,850
Second, given the rectangle around
第二 通过得到的文字区域的

105
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,390
that text region, we can
矩形轮廓

106
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,930
then do character segmentation, where
我们可以进行字符切分

107
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,210
we might take this text box
比如对这个文字框

108
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,310
that says "Antique Mall" and
我们或许能认出“ANTIQUE MALL”

109
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,760
try to segment it out
然后我们会试着将其

110
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,150
into the locations of the individual characters.
分割成独立的字符

111
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,280
And finally, having segmented out
最后 在成功将字段分割为

112
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,050
into individual characters, we can
独立的字符后

113
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,040
then run a crossfire, which
我们可以运行一个分类器

114
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,950
looks at the images of the
输入这些可识别的字符

115
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,620
visual characters, and tries to
然后试着识别出

116
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,990
figure out the first character's an
第一个字母是一个A

117
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,070
A, the second character's an
第二个字母是一个N

118
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,010
N, the third character is
第三个字母是一个T

119
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,930
a T, and so on,
等等

120
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,130
so that up by doing all
因此通过完成所有这些工作

121
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,350
this how that hopefully you can then
按理说你就能识别出

122
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,610
figure out that this phrase
这个字段写的是

123
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,670
is Rulegee's antique mall
LULAB'S ANTIQUE MALL

124
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,760
and similarly for some of
然后图片中其他有文字的地方

125
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,690
the other words that appear in that image.
也是类似的方法进行处理

126
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,390
I should say that there are some photo OCR systems
实际上有很多照片OCR系统

127
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,350
that do even more complex things,
会进行更为复杂的处理

128
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,370
like a bit of spelling correction at the end.
比如在最后会进行拼写校正

129
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,470
So if, for example, your
所以比如说

130
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,730
character segmentation and character
假如你的字符分割

131
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,450
classification system tells you
和分类系统告诉你

132
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,390
that it sees the
它识别到的字是

133
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,050
word c 1 e a
“C 1 E A N I N G”

134
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,930
n i n g. Then,
那么

135
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,570
you know, a sort of spelling
很多拼写修正系统

136
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,910
correction system might tell
会告诉你

137
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,270
you that this is probably the
这可能是单词

138
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,880
word 'cleaning', and your
“cleaning”的拼写

139
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,160
character classification algorithm had
你的字符分类算法

140
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,650
just mistaken the l for a 1.
刚才把字母 l 识别成了数字 1

141
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,320
But for the purpose of what
但在这节课中

142
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,510
we want to do in
我们要做的事情

143
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,980
this video, let's ignore this last
会不考虑最后这一步

144
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,780
step and just focus on the
只关注前面三个步骤

145
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,490
system that does these three

155
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,350
out the characters--the individual characters in

156
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,360
the text--and then finally we recognize the individual characters.
最后我们队单个的字母进行识别
