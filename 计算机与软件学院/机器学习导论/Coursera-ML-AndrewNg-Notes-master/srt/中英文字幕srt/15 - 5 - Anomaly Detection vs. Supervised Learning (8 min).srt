00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,210
In the last video, we talked
在上一讲中，我们讨论了(字幕翻译：中国海洋大学 刘竞)

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,950
about the process of evaluating
评估一个

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,780
an anomaly detection algorithm and
异常检测算法的过程

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,980
there we started to use some
当时我们使用了一些带有标签的数据,

5
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,810
labelled data, with examples
对于使用的例子，我们知道

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,150
that we knew were either anomalous
它们要么是正常的

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,170
or not anomalous, with y equals 1 or y equals 0.
要么是异常的，y要么等于1，要么等于0.

8
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,380
So the question then arises, if
所以问题就出来了，
9
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,700
we have this labeled data,
假如我们有这些带有标签的数据，

9
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,620
we have some examples that are
我们有一些例子，我们知道

10
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,840
known to be anomalies and some
它们是异常，还有一些例子

11
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,850
that are known not to be not
我们知道它们是正常的，

12
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,540
anomalies, why don't we
那么为什么我们不用

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,580
just use a supervised learning algorithm,
一个监督学习算法，

14
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,790
so why don't we just use
那么为什么我们不用一个

15
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,360
logistic regression or a neural
逻辑回归或者一个神经

16
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,770
network to try to
网络算法去试图

17
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,260
learn directly from our labeled
从我们的带标签的数据中直接学习,

18
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,120
data, to predict whether y equals one or y equals zero.
并去预测是否y等于1或者y等于0呢？

19
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,900
In this video, I'll try to
在这个视频中，我将尝试去

20
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,170
share with you some of
和大学一起分享

21
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,820
the thinking and some guidelines for
一些思想以及指导方针，这将用于

22
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,610
when you should probably use an
当你可能会使用一个

23
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,160
anomaly detection algorithm and when
异常检测算法的情况，但是当你

24
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,500
it might be more fruitful to consider
使用一个监督学习算法时

25
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,380
using a supervised learning algorithm.
将会更加有效的情况。

26
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,950
This slide shows, what are
从这个幻灯片可以看到，

27
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,130
the settings under which you should
什么情况下你

28
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,370
maybe use anomaly detection versus
很可能使用异常检测算法，

29
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,590
when supervised learning might be more fruitful.
以及什么情况下使用监督学习算法更有效。

30
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,440
If you have a problem with a
如果你有一个问题，问题中有

31
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,820
very small number of positive
很少数量的正例，

32
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,780
examples, and remember examples of
记住，当这些例子

33
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,000
y equals one are the
的y的取值等于1时，

34
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,520
anomalous examples, then
它们是异常的例子，

35
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,160
you might consider using an anomaly detection algorithm inset.
那么你可以考虑使用一个嵌入的异常检测算法。

36
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,430
So having 0 to 20,
所以如果有0到20个

37
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,740
maybe up to 50 positive examples,
可能最多到50个正例，

38
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,190
might be pretty typical, and usually,
这可能是很典型的，并且通常情况下，

39
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,810
we have such a small set
我们有很少数量的

40
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,340
of positive examples,
正例，

41
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,170
we are going to save the positive
我们会把这些正例保留下来，

42
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,530
examples just for the cross
仅是把它们作为交叉
44
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,440
validation sets and test sets.
验证集和测试集。

43
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,130
In contrast, in a typical
与些相反，在一个典型的

44
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,560
normal anomaly detection setting,
正规的异常检测下，

45
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,630
we will often have a relatively
我们通常将会有一个相对更大

46
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,340
large number of negative examples,
数量的反例，

47
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,300
of these normal examples of
比如说这些正常的

48
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,710
normal aircraft engines.
航空发动机。

49
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,900
And we can then use this very
我们可以用这些更大

50
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,240
large number of negative examples,
数量的反例，

51
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,510
with which to fit the model
去拟合

52
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,090
p of x.  And so, there is
关于x的模型p. 因此，
55
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,930
this idea in many anomaly detection
在许多异常检测

53
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,510
applications, you have
应用中有这样一个思想，

54
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,220
very few positive examples, and
你有很少的正例，

55
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,540
lots of negative examples, and when
很多的反例，

56
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,960
we are doing the process of
当我们在估计关于x的模型p的过程中，

57
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,520
estimating p of x, of fitting all those Gaussian parameters,
当我们拟合这些高斯参数时，

58
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,690
we need only negative examples to do that.
我们只需要反例就够了。

59
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,680
So if you have a lot of negative data,
所以，如果你有大量的反例数据，

60
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,310
we can still fit to p of x pretty well.
你仍然可以很好的拟合关于x的模型p.

61
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,090
In contrast, for supervised learning,
与此相反，对于监督学习而言，

62
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,790
more typically we would have
更为典型情况是我们需要

63
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,810
a reasonably large number of
有一个合理的数量比较大的

64
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,370
both positive and negative examples.
正例和反例。

65
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,970
And so this is one
所以，这是一个

66
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,240
way to look at your problem
观察你的问题的方式

67
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,860
and decide if you should use
以决定你是应该使用

68
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,180
an anomaly detection algorithm or a supervised learning algorithm.
一个异常检测算法还是一个监督学习算法。

69
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,750
Here is another way people often think about anomaly detection algorithms.
这有另外一个人们经常思考异常检测算法的方式。

70
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,890
So, for anomaly detection applications
确实如此，对于许多异常检测的应用，

71
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,890
often there are many
经常有许多

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,600
different types of anomalies.
不同类型的异常。

73
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,770
So think about aircraft engines.
比如航空发动机。

74
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,680
You know there are so many different ways for aircraft engines to go wrong.
你们知道当发动机异常时，有许多不同的异常形式。

75
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,980
Right? There are so many things that could go wrong that could break an aircraft engine.
对吧？有许多方面可以出现故障，打断航空发动机的正常工作。

76
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,080
And so, if that's the
因此，如果情况就是这样，

77
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,940
case and you have a pretty small
你有很少数量的

78
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,560
set of positive examples, then
正例，那么

79
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,760
it can be difficult for
这将很困难，

80
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,380
an algorithm to learn from your small
如果使用一个算法从你的

81
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,130
set of positive examples what the anomalies look like.
这么少数量的正例中去学习异常是什么。

82
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,880
And in particular,
尤其是

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,050
you know, future anomalies may look
你也知道，未来可能出现的异常

84
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,750
nothing like the ones you've seen so far.
可能与你至今见过的异常完全不同。

85
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,540
So maybe in your set
可能在你的

86
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,030
of positive examples, maybe you
正例中，有5个或者10个，或者20个

87
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,740
had seen 5 or 10, or 20
你已经见过的

88
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,960
different ways that an aircraft engine could go wrong.
航空发动机发生故障的不同情况。

89
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,600
But maybe tomorrow, you
但是，可能到了明天，你

90
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,110
need to detect a totally

you have just never seen before,

96
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,010
and if that is the case,
并且，假如情况就是这样，

97
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,460
then it might be more
那么它将更

98
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,020
promising to just model
有希望，如果去为反例建立

99
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,770
the negative examples, with a

100
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,620
sort of a Gaussian model

101
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,950
P of X. Rather than try

102
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,250
too hard to model the positive

103
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,850
examples, because, you know,

tomorrow's anomaly may be

106
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,640
In contrast, in some other

107
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,170
problems you have enough

108
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,790
positive examples for an algorithm

109
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,850
to get a sense of what the positive examples are like.

110
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,860
And in particular, if you
并且尤其是，假如你

111
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,270
think that future positive examples
认为未来的正例

112

are likely to be similar

113
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,980
to ones in the training set,
训练集中的正例很相似。

114
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,090
then in that setting it might
那么，在这种情况下，

115
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,720
be more reasonable to have a supervised learning algorithm,
使用一个监督学习算法将会更合理，

116
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,390
that looks at a lot of
算法通过察看

117
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,760
the positive examples, looks at a
正例，察看很多的

118
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,530
lot of the negative examples, and

119
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,980
uses that to try to distinguish between positives and negatives.
去尝试区分正例和反例。

120
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,780
So hopefully this gives you
希望这些可以让你

121
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,180
a sense of if you have
明白，当你有一个

122
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,690
a specific problem you should think
特定的问题，你能知道

123
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,800
about using the anomaly
你应该使用异常检测算法

124
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,450
detection algorithm or a supervised learning algorithm.
还是监督学习算法。

125
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,340
And the key difference really is,
最关键的不同之处在于

126
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,870
that in anomaly detection, after
在异常检测中，

127
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,040
we have such a small
我们只有很少数量的

128
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,200
number of positive examples that there
正例，以致于对于一个

129
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,640
is not possible, for a learning
学习算法而言，它是不可能

130
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,810
algorithm to learn that much from the positive examples.
从正例中学习到足够的知识。

131
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,440
And so what we do instead,
所以，我们应该做的是

132
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,050
is take a large set of
采用大量的

133
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,420
negative examples, and have it just
反例， 并且让它学习

134
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,070
learned a lot, learned p
很多，学习到

135
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,300
of x from just the negative

136
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,730
examples of the normal aircraft engines, say.
例如这些反例就是正常的航空发动机。

137
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,480
And we reserve the small
我们保留小数量的

138
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,740
number of positive examples for evaluating our algorithm
正例去评估我们的算法，

139
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,680
to use in either the cross validation sets or the test sets.
