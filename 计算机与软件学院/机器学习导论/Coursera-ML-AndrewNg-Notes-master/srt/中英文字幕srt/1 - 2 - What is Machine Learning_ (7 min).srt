What is machine learning? In this video we
will try to define what it is and also try
什么是机器学习？本视频中将设法定义什么是机器学习，并

2
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:09,520
to give you a sense of when you want to
use machine learning. Even among machine
设法告诉你机器学习应该在什么情况下使用。即使在

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,252
learning practitioners there isn't a well
accepted definition of what is and what
机器学习从业者中，也没有对机器学习的统一定义。

4
00:00:14,252 --> 00:00:18,926
isn't machine learning. But let me show
 you a couple of examples of the ways that
但下面我将告诉你们一些现有的对机器学习的定义。

5
00:00:18,926 --> 00:00:23,600
people have tried to define it. Here's the
definition of what is machine learning
下面是Arthur Samuel提出的关于机器学习做什么的定义。

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,520
does to Arthur Samuel. He defined machine
learning as the field of study that gives
他定义机器学习是一个学习领域，并在没有明确训练的情况下，

7
00:00:29,037 --> 00:00:33,554
computers the ability to learn without being
explicitly programmed. Samuel's claim to
教给计算机学习的能力。追溯到1950's，

8
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:38,452
fame was that back in the 1950's, he wrote
a checkers playing program. And the
Samuel成名的原因是他编写了跳棋游戏程序。

9
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:43,603
amazing thing about this checkers playing
 program, was that Arthur Samuel himself,
并且这个跳棋游戏程序的令人惊讶之处是Arthur Samuel自己并不是一个玩跳棋高手。

10
00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:48,268
wasn't a very good checkers player. But
what he did was, he had to program for it to play
但他所做的是编程使计算机与自己

11
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:52,245
10's of 1000's of games against itself.
And by watching what sorts of board
玩10次’1000次。通过观察哪些布局会赢，

12
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:56,698
positions tended to lead to wins, and what
 sort of board positions tended to lead to
哪些布局会输。

13
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:00,725
losses. The checkers playing program
learns over time what are good board
一段时间后，跳棋游戏程序就学到了什么是好的布局，

14
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:04,713
positions and what are bad board
positions. And eventually learn to play
什么是不好的布局。最终，就学会了玩跳棋，

15
00:01:04,713 --> 00:01:09,514
checkers better than Arthur Samuel himself
was able to. This was a remarkable result.
比Arthur Samuel玩得更好。这是一个引人注目的结果。

16
00:01:09,514 --> 00:01:14,535
Although Samuel himself turned out not to be a
very good checkers player. But because the
虽然，Samuel自己并不是一个好的跳棋玩者，但

17
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:19,254
computer has the patience to play tens
 of thousands of games itself. No
计算机有耐心与自己玩成百上千次。

18
00:01:19,254 --> 00:01:24,275
human, has the patience to play that many
games. By doing this the computer was able
没有一个人有这种耐心玩这么多次游戏。因此，计算机能获得

19
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:29,235
to get so much checkers-playing experience that it eventually became a
如此丰富的跳棋游戏经验，最终成为了一个

20
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:33,817
better checkers player than Arthur Samuel
 himself. This is somewhat informal
比Arthur Samuel更好的跳棋玩者。这是有点不正式的定义，

21
00:01:33,817 --> 00:01:38,547
definition, and an older one. Here's a
slightly more recent definition by Tom
也是较老的一个定义。下面是一个稍近时间的定义，由Tom Mitchell定义，

22
00:01:38,547 --> 00:01:43,607
Mitchell, who's a friend out of Carnegie
Mellon. So Tom defines machine learning by
他是在卡内基梅陇大学的一个朋友。Tom是这样定义机器学习的，

23
00:01:43,607 --> 00:01:48,819
saying that, a well posed learning problem
is defined as follows. He says, a computer
一个良好的学习问题定义如下：

24
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:53,843
program is said to learn from experience
E, with respect to some task T, and some
计算机程序从经验E中学习任务T，

25
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:58,678
performance measure P, if its
performance on T as measured by P improves
并用度量P来衡量性能。条件是它由P定义的关于T的性能随着经验E而提高。

26
00:01:58,678 --> 00:02:03,764
with experience E. I actually think he came
 up with this definition just to make it
我确实认为他如此提出定义只是想使它更押韵。

27
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:08,346
rhyme. For the checkers playing
example the experience e, will be the
对于跳棋游戏，经验E就是

28
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:13,253
experience of having the program play 10's
of 1000's of games against itself. The
计算机与自己玩10次，1000次的跳棋；

29
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:17,735
task t, will be the task of playing
 checkers. And the performance measure p,
任务T就是玩跳棋的任务；性能度量P就是

30
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:22,399
will be the probability that it
wins the next game of checkers against
与新对手玩跳棋时赢的概率。

31
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:27,157
some new opponent. Throughout these
videos, besides me trying to teach you
本视频中，除了由我教你们学习外，

32
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:32,291
study, I will occasionally ask you a
 question to make sure you understand the
我将偶尔问你们一个问题以确保你们已经理解内容了。

33
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:36,891
content. Here's one, on top is a
definition of machine learning by Tom

34
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:42,292
Mitchell. Let's say your email program
watches which emails you do or do not flag
假设你的邮件程序观察哪封邮件你将标为垃圾邮件，哪封将不标。

35
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:47,826
as spam. So in an email client like this
 you might click this spam button to report
因此在邮件客户端，你可能点击垃圾邮件按钮标记这一些邮件为垃圾邮件，

36
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:53,263
some email as spam, but not other emails
and. Based on which emails you mark as
另外一些不是。基于此，

37
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:59,046
spam, so your e-mail program learns better
how to filter spam e-mail. What is the
你的邮件程序更好地学习如何过滤垃圾邮件。

38
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:04,290
task T in this setting? In a few seconds,
the video will pause. And when it does so,
在这个例子中，任务T是什么？接下来的几秒，视频会暂停，

39
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,598
you can use your mouse to select one of
these four radio buttons to let, to let me
你们可以用鼠标来选择四个按键中的一个告诉我

40
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:40,190
know which of these four you think is the
right answer to this question. That might
你认为四个中的哪个是正确答案。

41
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,747
be a performance measure P. And so, our
 task performance on the task our system's
它可能是性能度量P。因此，我们的系统关于任务T的性能，

42
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:50,529
performance on the task T, on the
performance measure P will improve after
随着经验E而提高的性能度量P。

43
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:55,957
the experience E. In this class I hope to
teach you about various different types of
本课程中，我希望教给你们各种各样不同类型的学习算法。

44
00:03:55,957 --> 00:04:00,933
learning algorithms. There are several
different types of learning algorithms.
目前也有各种不同类型的学习算法。

45
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:05,650
The main two types are what we call
supervised learning and unsupervised
主要有两类：监督学习和非监督学习。

46
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,690
learning. I'll define what these terms
mean more in the next couple videos. But
在下个视频中，我将定义这些名词的含义。

47
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:16,028
it turns out that in supervised learning,
the idea is that we're going to teach the
监督学习，就是我们教计算机如何做事情，

48
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:20,513
computer how to do something, whereas in
unsupervised learning we're going let
然而，在非监督学习中，我们将让计算机自己学习。

49
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:25,016
it learn by itself. Don't worry if these
two terms don't make sense yet, in the
不要担心这两个词没有意义，

50
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:29,739
next two videos I'm going to say exactly
what these two types of learning are. You
在下个视频中，我将准确说明这两类学习是什么。

51
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:34,070
will also hear other buzz terms such as
reinforcement learning and recommender
你也会听到其它的名词，如增强学习和推荐系统。

52
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,621
systems. These are other types of machine
learning algorithms that we'll talk about
这些是其它类型的机器学习算法，我们将会在以后讨论。

53
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:42,460
later but the two most used types of
learning algorithms are probably
但是最常使用的两类算法是

54
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,791
supervised learning and unsupervised
learning and I'll define them in the next
监督学习和非监督学习。我将在下两个视频中定义，

55
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:51,123
two videos and we'll spend most of this
class talking about these two types of
并且我们会用大部分的课时来讨论这两类学习算法。

56
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:55,720
learning algorithms. It turns out one of
the other things we'll spend a lot of time
另外，我们将会花大量时间说明

57
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,054
on in this class is practical advice for
applying learning algorithms. This is
应用学习算法时的实际建议。

58
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:04,444
something that I feel pretty strongly
 about, and it's actually something that I
这也是我觉得很有用的，也是据我所知

59
00:05:04,444 --> 00:05:08,167
don't know of any other university
teaches. Teaching about learning
其它大学未教的。教授学习算法

60
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:12,509
algorithms is like giving you a set of
tools, and equally important or more
就像给你一组工具，但和给你工具同样重要的或者说更重要的是

61
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:17,616
important to giving you the tools is to
teach you how to apply these tools. I like
教你如何使用这些工具。

62
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:22,413
to make an analogy to learning to become a
carpenter. Imagine that someone is
我喜欢用学习成为一个木匠做比喻。想象一下，某人

63
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:26,959
teaching you how to be a carpenter and
they say here's a hammer, here's a
在教你如何成为一个木匠，并且他说这是一个榔头，这是一个

64
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,077
screwdriver, here's a saw, good luck.
Well, that's no good, right? You, you, you
螺丝刀，这是一个锯子。好运气，可是，事实上并不好。

65
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:34,799
have all these tools, but the more
important thing, is to learn how to use
你有了所有的工具，但更重要的是要学习如何正确地使用这些工具。

66
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:38,927
these tools properly. There's a huge
 difference between, between people that
对知道如何使用机器学习算法的人，

67
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:43,456
know how to use these machines learning
algorithms, versus people who don't know
与不知道如何使用机器学习的比较，将有很大的不同。

68
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:47,626
how to use these tools well. Here in
Silicon Valley where I live, when I go
在硅谷，当我

69
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:52,328
visit different companies even at the
top Silicon Valley companies very often I see
参观不同的公司，即使是在那些我看到

70
00:05:52,328 --> 00:05:56,428
people are trying to apply machine
 learning algorithms to some problem and
他们设法在一些问题上应用机器学习算法的公司，

71
00:05:56,428 --> 00:06:00,857
sometimes they have been going at it for
six months. But sometimes when I look at
有时他们已经在问题上做了6个月。

72
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:05,121
what they're doing I, I, I say, you know,
I could have told them like, gee, I could
当我看到他们在做时，我会说，你知道，我真希望我在

73
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:09,714
have told you six months ago that you
should be taking a learning algorithm and
六个月前就告诉你们，你们应该使用学习算法，

74
00:06:09,714 --> 00:06:14,470
applying it in like the slightly modified
way and your chance of success would have
并且小小修改一下，成功率就会高很多。

75
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,648
been much higher. So what we're going to
do in this class is actually spend a lot
因此，本课程中要做的就是花大量的时间讨论

76
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:23,523
of time talking about how, if you actually
 tried to develop a machine learning
假设你确实设法开发机器学习系统，

77
00:06:23,523 --> 00:06:27,596
system, how to make those best practices
type decisions about the way in which you
那么对于你建立你的系统的方式，如何作出那些最佳的实际类型决策，

78
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,321
build your system so that when you're
applying learning algorithm you're less
以致于当你应用学习算法时，你不大可能

79
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:35,394
likely to end up one of those people who
 end up pursuing some path for six months
像那些在做了六个月后放弃的人一样，就此结束放弃。

80
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:39,373
that, you know, someone else could have
 figured out it just wasn't gonna work at
其它人可能已经明白它根本不值得做，

81
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:43,515
all and it's just a waste of time for six
months. So I'm actually going to spend a
它只是浪费了六个月的时间。因此，我将花费大量的时间

82
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:47,707
lot of the time teaching you those sorts
of best practices in machine learning and
来教你们机器学习和AI中那些最好的实践经验，

83
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:52,052
AI and how to get this stuff to work and
how we do it, how the best people do it in
以及如何使这项任务工作，我们如何来做，硅谷和世界上最优秀的人是如何做的。

84
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:56,143
Silicon Valley and around the world. I
hope to make you one of the best people in
我希望使你们成为

85
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:59,905
knowing how to design and build serious
machine learning and AI systems. So,
在知道如何设计和建立各种各样的机器学习及AI系统方面最好的人。

86
00:06:59,905 --> 00:07:04,698
that's machine learning and these are the
main topics I hope to teach. In the next
因此，机器学习以及如上提到的是我最希望教的。

87
00:07:04,698 --> 00:07:09,023
video, I'm going to define what is
supervised learning and after that, what
下一个视频，我将定义什么是监督学习，之后介绍什么是非监督学习。

88
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:13,757
is unsupervised learning. And also, start
to talk about when you would use each of them.
并且，开始讨论你可以在什么时候使用它们。
