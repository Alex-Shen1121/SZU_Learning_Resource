in this video we will start
在这段视频中 我们将开始
(字幕整理：中国海洋大学 黄海广,haiguang2000@qq.com )

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,600
to talk about a new version
介绍一种新的

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,880
of linear regression that's more powerful.
更为有效的线性回归形式

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,230
One that works with multiple variables
这种形式适用于多个变量

5
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,070
or with multiple features.
或者多特征量的情况

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:10,860
Here's what I mean.
比如说：

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,670
In the original version of
在之前我们学习过的

8
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,920
linear regression that we developed,
线性回归中

9
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,590
we have a single feature x,
我们只有一个单一特征量

10
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,450
the size of the house, and
房屋面积 x

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,650
we wanted to use that to
我们希望用这个特征量

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,510
predict why the price of
来预测

13
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,210
the house and this was
房子的价格

14
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,590
our form of our hypothesis.
这就是我们的假设

15
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,210
But now imagine, what if
但是想象一下

16
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,580
we had not only the size
如果我们不仅有房屋面积

17
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,440
of the house as a feature
作为预测房屋

18
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,450
or as a variable of which
价格的特征量

19
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,490
to try to predict the price,
或者变量

20
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,270
but that we also knew the
我们还知道

21
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,710
number of bedrooms, the number
卧室的数量

22
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,490
of house and the age of the home and years.
楼层的数量以及房子的使用年限

23
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,050
It seems like this would give
这样就给了我们

24
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,630
us a lot more information with which to predict the price.
更多可以用来

25
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,130
To introduce a little bit
预测房屋价格的信息

26
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,760
of notation, we sort of
先简单介绍一下记法

27
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,910
started to talk about this earlier,
我们开始的时候就提到过

28
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,800
I'm going to use the variables
我要用

29
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,300
X subscript 1 X subscript
x 下标1

30
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,320
2 and so on to
x 下标2  等等

31
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,780
denote my, in this
来表示

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,000
case, four features and I'm
这种情况下的四个特征量

33
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,500
going to continue to use
然后仍然用

34
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,780
Y to denote the variable,
Y来表示我们

35
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,720
the output variable price that we're trying to predict.
所想要预测的输出变量

36
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,600
Let's introduce a little bit more notation.
让我们来看看更多的表示方式

37
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,210
Now that we have four features
现在我们有四个特征量

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,490
I'm going to use lowercase "n"
我要用小写n

39
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,670
to denote the number of features.
来表示特征量的数目

40
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,460
So in this example we have
因此在这个例子中 我们的n等于4

41
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,420
n4 because we have, you
因为你们看 我们有

42
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,610
know, one, two, three, four features.
1 2 3 4 共4个特征量

43
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,880
And "n" is different from
这里的n和我们之前

44
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,280
our earlier notation where we
使用的n不同

45
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,670
were using "n" to denote the number of examples.
之前我们是用的“m”来表示样本的数量

46
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,640
So if you have
所以如果你有47行

47
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,070
47 rows  "M" is the
那么m就是这个表格里面的行数

48
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,580
number of rows on this table or the number of training examples.
或者说是训练样本数

49
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,290
So I'm also
然后我要用x 上标 (i)

50
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,910
going to use X superscript
来表示第i个

51
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,050
"I" to denote the
训练样本的

52
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,460
input features of the "I" training example.
输入特征值

53
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,580
X2 is going to
x上标 (2)

54
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,300
be a vector of
就是表示第二个

55
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,690
the features for my second training example.
训练样本的特征向量

56
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,020
And so X2 here is
因此这里

57
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,260
going to be a vector 1416,
x(2)就是向量 [1416, 3, 2, 40]

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,560
3, 2, 40 since those
因为这四个数字对应了

59
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,110
are my four
我用来预测房屋价格的

60
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,100
features that I have
第二个房子的

61
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,410
to try to predict the price of the second house.
四个特征量

62
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,470
So, in this notation, the
因此在这种记法中

63
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,250
superscript 2 here.
这个上标2

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,620
That's an index into my training set.
就是训练集的一个索引

65
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,630
This is not X to the power of 2.
而不是x的2次方

66
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,150
Instead, this is, you know,
这个2就对应着

67
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,430
an index that says look at the second row of this table.
你所看到的表格中的第二行

68
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,260
This refers to my second training example.
即我的第二个训练样本

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,780
With this notation X2 is
x上标(2) 这样表示

70
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,890
a four dimensional vector.
就是一个四维向量

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,760
In fact, more generally, this is
事实上更普遍地来说

72
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,630
an in-dimensional feature back there.
这是n维的向量

73
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,030
subscript J to denote
 下标j

74
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,740
the value of the J,
来表示

75
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,420
of feature number J
第i个训练样本的

76
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,360
and the training example.
第j个特征量

77
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,490
So concretely X2 subscript 3,
因此具体的来说

78
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,130
will refer to feature
x上标(2)下标3代表着

79
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,800
number three in the
第2个训练样本里的第3个特征量

80
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,670
x factor which is equal to 2,right?
对吧？

81
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,360
That was a 3 over there, just fix my handwriting.
这个是3 我写的不太好看

82
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,810
So x2 subscript 3 is going to be equal to 2.
所以说x上标(2)下标3就等于2

83
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,010
Now that we have multiple features,
既然我们有了多个特征量

84
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,390
let's talk about what the
让我们继续讨论一下

85
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,360
form of our hypothesis should be.
我们的假设形式应该是怎样的

86
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,790
Previously this was the
这是我们之前使用的假设形式

87
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,650
form of our hypothesis, where x
x就是我们唯一的特征量

88
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,280
was our single feature, but
但现在我们有了多个特征量

89
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,450
now that we have multiple features,
我们就不能再

90
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,350
we aren't going to use the simple representation any more.
使用这种简单的表示方式了

91
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,040
Instead, a form
取而代之的

92
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,140
of the hypothesis in linear regression
我们将把线性回归的假设

93
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,630
is going to be this, can be
改成这样

94
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,190
theta 0 plus theta
θ0加上

95
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,690
1 x1 plus theta 2
θ1 乘以 x1 加上

96
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,320
x2 plus theta 3 x3
θ2乘以x2 加上 θ3 乘以x3

97
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,140
plus theta 4 X4.
加上θ4乘以x4

98
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,610
And if we have N features then
然后如果我们有n个特征量

99
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,110
rather than summing up over
那么我们要将所有的n个特征量相加

100
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,380
our four features, we would have
而不是四个特征量

101
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,050
a sum over our N features.
我们需要对n个特征量进行相加

102
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,270
Concretely for a particular
举个具体的例子

103
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,880
setting of our parameters we
在我们的设置的参数中

104
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,500
may have H of
我们可能有h(x)等于

105
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,990
X 80 + 0.1 X1 +  0.01x2 + 3x3 - 2x4.
80 + 0.1 x1 + 0.01x2 + 3x3  -  2x4

106
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,070
This would be one
这就是一个

107
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,060
example of a hypothesis
假设的范例

108
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,170
and you remember a
别忘了

109
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,710
hypothesis is trying to predict
假设是为了预测

110
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,020
the price of the house in
大约以千刀为单位的房屋价格

111
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,910
thousands of dollars, just saying
就是说

112
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,020
that, you know, the base
一个房子的价格

113
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,270
price of a house
可以是

114
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,960
is maybe 80,000 plus another open
80 k加上

115
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,960
1, so that's an extra,
0.1乘以x1

116
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,680
what, hundred dollars per square feet,
也就是说 每平方尺100美元

117
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,710
yeah, plus the price goes up
然后价格

118
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,340
a little bit for each
会随着楼层数的增加

119
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,300
up further for each additional
随着卧室数的增加

120
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,870
bedroom the house has, because
因为x3是

121
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,390
X three was the number
卧室的数量

122
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,890
of bedrooms, and the price
但是呢

123
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,090
goes down a little bit
房子的价格会

124
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,930
with each additional age of the house.
随着使用年数的增加

125
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,150
With each additional year of the age of the house.
而贬值

126
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,630
Here's the form of a hypothesis rewritten on the slide.
这是重新改写过的假设的形式

127
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,390
And what I'm gonna do is
接下来

128
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,560
introduce a little bit of
我要来介绍一点

129
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,300
notation to simplify this equation.
简化这个等式的表示方式

130
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,660
For convenience of notation, let
为了表示方便

131
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,800
me define x subscript 0 to be equals one.
我要将x下标0的值设为1

132
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,080
Concretely, this means that for
具体而言 这意味着

133
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,770
every example i I
对于第i个样本

134
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,300
have a feature vector X superscript
都有一个向量x上标(i)

135
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,500
I and X superscript
并且x上标(i)

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,370
I subscript 0 is going to be equal to 1.
下标0等于1

137
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,990
You can think of this as defining
你可以认为我们

138
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,590
an additional zero feature.
定义了一个额外的第0个特征量

139
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,320
So whereas previously I had
因此 我过去有n个特征量

140
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,790
n features because x1, x2
因为我们有x1 x2

141
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,920
through xn, I'm now defining
直到xn 由于我另外定义了

142
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,150
an additional sort of zero
额外的第0个特征向量

143
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,910
feature vector that always takes
并且它的取值

144
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,590
on the value of one.
总是1

145
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,860
So now my feature vector
所以我现在的特征向量x

146
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,390
X becomes this N+1 dimensional
是一个从0开始标记的

147
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,020
vector that is zero index.
n+1维的向量

148
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,080
So this is now a n+1
所以现在就是一个

149
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,650
dimensional feature vector, but
n+1维的特征量向量

150
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,200
I'm gonna index it from
但我要从0开始标记

151
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,400
0 and I'm also going
同时

152
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,950
to think of my
我也想把我的参数

153
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,240
parameters as a vector.
都看做一个向量

154
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,620
So, our parameters here, right
所以我们的参数就是

155
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,800
that would be our theta zero,
我们的θ0

156
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,130
theta one, theta two, and so
θ1 θ2 等等

157
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,780
on all the way up to theta n,
直到θn

158
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,950
we're going to gather
我们要把

159
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,580
them up into a parameter
所有的参数都写成一个向量

160
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,030
vector written theta 0, theta
θ0

161
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,990
1, theta 2, and so
θ1 θ2

162
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,390
on, down to theta n.
直到θn

163
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,160
This is another zero index vector.
这里也有一个从0开始标记的矢量

164
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,590
It's of index signed from zero.
下标从0开始

165
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,380
That is another n plus 1 dimensional vector.
这是另外一个

166
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,840
So, my hypothesis cannot be
所以我的假设

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,720
written theta 0x0 plus
现在可以写成θ0乘以x0

168
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,560
theta 1x1+ up to
加上θ1乘以x1直到

169
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,330
theta n Xn.
θn 乘以xn

170
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,310
And this equation is
这个等式

171
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,600
the same as this on
和上面的等式是一样的

172
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,670
top because, you know,
因为你看

173
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,710
eight zero is equal to one.
x0等于1

174
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,300
Underneath and I now
下面 我要

175
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,700
take this form of the
把这种形式假设等式

176
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,130
hypothesis and write this
写成

177
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,990
as either transpose x,
θ转置乘以X

178
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,910
depending on how familiar
取决于你对

179
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,960
you are with inner products of
向量内积有多熟悉

180
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,050
vectors if you
如果你展开

181
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,880
write what theta transfers x
θ转置乘以X

182
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,260
is what theta transfer and
那么就得到

183
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,370
this is theta zero,
θ0

184
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,730
theta one, up to theta
θ1直到θn

185
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,880
N. So this
这个就是θ转置

186
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,910
thing here is theta transpose
实际上

187
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,820
and this is actually a N
这就是一个

188
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,930
plus one by one matrix.
n+1乘以1维的矩阵

189
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,600
It's also called a row vector
也被称为行向量

190
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,160
and you take that and
用行向量

191
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,420
multiply it with the
与X向量相乘

192
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,440
vector X which is X
X向量是

193
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,560
zero, X one, and so
x0 x1等等

194
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,790
on, down to X n.
直到xn

195
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,400
And so, the inner product
因此内积就是

196
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,050
that is theta transpose X
θ转置乘以X

197
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:48,810
is just equal to this.
就等于这个等式

198
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,610
This gives us a convenient way
这就为我们提供了一个

199
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,830
to write the form of the
表示假设的

200
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,310
hypothesis as just the inner
更加便利的形式

201
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,240
product between our parameter
即用参数向量θ以及

202
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,200
vector theta and our theta
特征向量X的内积

203
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,220
vector X. And it
这就是改写以后的

204
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,360
is this little bit of notation,
表示方法

205
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,270
this little excerpt of the
这样的表示习惯

206
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,690
notation convention that let
就让我们

207
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,530
us write this in this compact form.
可以以这种紧凑的形式写出假设

208
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,230
So that's the form of a hypthesis when we have multiple features.
这就是多特征量情况下的假设形式

209
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,940
And, just to give this another
起另一个名字

210
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,330
name, this is also
就是

211
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,860
called multivariate linear regression.
所谓的多元线性回归

212
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,640
And the term multivariable that's just
多元一词

213
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,300
maybe a fancy term for saying
也就是用来预测的多个特征量

214
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,370
we have multiple features, or
或者变量

215
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,900
multivariables with which to try to predict the value Y.
就是一种更加好听的说法罢了
